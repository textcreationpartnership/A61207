            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He natural Sun in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether we conſider the vaſtneſs of its Globe, or the ſplendour, and dazling of its light, or the variety and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficialneſs of its motion, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, attended with duration, and perpetuity, is the top, and Prince of all inanimate beings. Yet the leaſt inſect that the moſt <hi>Artificial Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcope</hi> can diſcern life in, is able to weigh againſt it, and <hi>in genere entium</hi> is more perfect. How excellent a being then is the Soul of man, that doth not only out-ſtrip the Sun, but all other ſenſitive things, even thoſe that have the moſt lively <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher calls them, which the Oratour tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlates <hi>Virtutum ſimulacra,</hi> the faint imitations of Reaſon. Now, among the many demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of the excellency of the Humane Soul,
<pb facs="tcp:64536:3"/> the operations of it do abundantly witneſs for it, and among them, to go no farther, the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of thoſe two ſupream Faculties, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Will, in apprehending, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God. Theſe are more excellent than the Suns enlightning the world. I chooſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in that, becauſe the ornament, beauty, life of all things depend upon it; for to what purpoſe were theſe things made, were it not that the light of the Sun made them <hi>Proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè viſibilia?</hi> Yet this is nothing in compare with the Soul of man, in its apprehending and loving God. This ſpeaks the Subject endued with a principle not to be tranſcended (but only in degree) in perfection. You cannot have more perſect operations in heaven in kind, though you may in degree. Angels, and Souls made perfect, it is true, do this more intirely, more perfectly, more conſtantly, and unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riedly: But in knowing God, and making choice of him, in loving, and cleaving to him, the ſouls of holy men do according to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the preſent ſtate communicate with them.</p>
            <p>Now theſe two have a mutual aſpect on each other, and the happy Conjunction of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Devotion ſpeak the Soul Regular and Uniform in its Acts, and to be in a good meaſure of ſpiritual health. When Knowledge doth
<pb facs="tcp:64536:3"/> guide and ſteer as it were Devotion, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion doth in a kind of gratitude warm, and enflame our Knowledge; which otherwiſe is apt to chil, and grow cold, as experience ſhews in many knowing Creatures, in whom the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Sanctuary have put out the fire. And as the ſeparation of the love of God from the knowledge of God breeds ſwarms of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites in the viſible Church, ſo the ſeparation of the knowledge of God from affection to God, begets a ſtrange kind of wild fire in the Spirits of men; and while they have Zeal for God (which is nothing but Affection in its full ſtature, got out of its ſwadling cloaths) without Knowledge, they are but like a Ship without a Rudder or Ballaſt, that is a prey to every Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and if it miſs them, is carried by its own levity, and the winds impetuouſneſs, on its own ruine. When therefore the bleſſed Spirit comes to work in the ſoul, he firſt enlightens the mind, and ſets open, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the gates of light, and then the Will ecchoes to the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and certainly that action is moſt congruous to ſo excellent a being as the Soul, when the Mind takes its aime before the Affections ſhoot. For otherwiſe, though the action doth prove materially good, yet it is no more commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him that doth it, than to him that ſhuts both his eyes, and then contingently hits the
<pb facs="tcp:64536:4"/> mark. The apprehenſions and affections of Mans Soul, being thus regulated, and conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, do admirably fit and diſpoſe for that we call Meditation: (I mean Divine and Chriſtian Meditation,) which is the off-ſpring of a good heart, and a good head. How excellent and ſweet an employment this is, none can know, but thoſe that have taſted it, and have the skill to ſpiritualize all objects, and providences, turning every thing by a Divine Chymiſtry, <hi>in ſuccum, &amp; ſanguincm,</hi> into ſpirit and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Making the Word, and Works, and Ordinances of God as ſo many Rounds to climbe up to a more clear Viſion, and fervent love of God; and then deſcending make theſe a clear Mirrour wherein they ſee themſelves, and to be like windows, to let in that light into the private and dark receſſes of the heart, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the hidden works of darkneſs; and ſo provokes the ſoul to endeavour a more through purgation of it ſelf, which it is the more eaſily exſtimulated to, being under a deep ſence of Gods purity, and a ſerious affection to be like him. But this duty of Divine and Spiritual Meditation, is a thing that in this degenerate age the generality of Chriſtians are utter ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to, and very hardly brought to the practice of. Though there was never any time wherein the thoughts and minds of men were more buſie
<pb facs="tcp:64536:4"/> and active, and the helps, inducements, and encouragements more plentiful and cogent, and the calls and invitations on Gods part both by his Word and Works more frequent. Yet it is a work of inexpreſſible difficulty, to bring theſe ſubtil and volatile acts of the mind to a fixati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to make any conſiderable immoration, upon thoſe ſubjects that are in themſelves of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt worth, and to us of the neareſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Now conſidering, that man is by God made a providential Creature, and doth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally caſt up damages, and gain, and project the obtaining the one, and avoiding the other. I have therefore thought it worth the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring what ſhould be the reaſon of their awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to this beneficial employment; and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that Knowledge and Love are the two things that diſpoſe for it. I have thought it might ariſe from ſome defect in theſe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thus argued. Surely, this wiſdom is too high for fools, that men that have incraſſated their ſouls, and almoſt extinguiſhed this Divine Lamp by ſhooting themſelves ſo deep in ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality and worldlineſs, that they who have well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh forgot their God, their own being, their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, ſhould ever be able to mount ſo high as Meditation. But when I conſidered, how ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid or ſottiſh ſoever theſe men were by debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, or pretended to be through want of
<pb facs="tcp:64536:5"/> education, yet they were ingeniouſly wicked, and could in their minds lay Schemes of villany, and that their phantaſies were alwaies minting and forging wicked devices, which they could in their ſecond thoughts reviſe and poliſh, and, like a Second Edition, make the Model to be <hi>Auctior &amp; nequior,</hi> larger and more wicked. I then ſaw no excuſe for them that had wit enough to be wicked, but none to do good. And therefore looking further into the ground of it, I found it aroſe from the ſecond, want of love to God, which is the ſtream that ſets all the Wheels of the ſoul a going; the true Spring of motion, and which ſtrongly conglutinates all the muſings of the ſoul. For to this work of Meditation there is not ſo much required vaſtneſs of knowledge, as rectitude of affections, not ſo much the head of a Schollar, as the heart of a Chriſtian. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it hindred by any thing more than by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and low affections, which both dim the eye of the underſtanding, and clog the appetite that it cannot hunger after, or reliſh theſe heavenly and ſpiritual dainties. Beſides, there is this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon to be given, That this part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is inward, and removed from the eyes of Spectators. Now, if it be difficult to bring men to a form of Religion any further than ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, intereſt, conveniencies, and the like, will ſtand with it, (which is the true reaſon many
<pb facs="tcp:64536:5"/> cry down all Forms, becauſe they feel their luſts pinched by them.) Much more difficult is it to bring men to thoſe inward, and vital acts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which would not only impriſon, but mortifie, not only check and ſtunt, but eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and exterminate ſin. As for that Religion which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> calls, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, The hidden man of the heart. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, being a Jew inwardly, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the circumcifion of the heart in the Spirit; and in another place, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, The new Creature, which ſtands in a ſelf exina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, in converſing with God, in a ſeparation from all ungodlineſs, and unrighteouſneſs, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming our ſelves to Chriſt, and living in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Laws. Theſe are looked on by a great many, but as <hi>Platonick Ideas,</hi> or as an <hi>Eutopia,</hi> or the Philoſophers happy man, things that are <hi>entia rationis,</hi> the dreams of melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fancies, and not worth the troubling our ſelves about.</p>
            <p>How much do we then owe to thoſe noble and generous ſouls, that in charity to our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and dulneſs, have given us a proof of the employment of their minds, and have ſo freely unboſomed themſelves to us, in their Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Soliloquies? In which we have the moſt free and genuine workings of their ſouls. Theſe being the honey in the combs of their
<pb facs="tcp:64536:6"/> labour and induſtry. Certainly, <hi>Chriſtian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> thy ſoul cannot but cleave to fuch perſons, whoſe drift and deſign thou ſeeſt it is to exalt God and ſet forth his Divine Perfections. Doſt thou not feel a ſtrange alteration in thy ſoul, while thou doſt but air thy ſelf at thoſe flames that heated their ſouls? Doſt thou not find thy heart glowing within thee, while thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with their labours, and while light is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon thee from their diſcourſes? Canſt thou look upon ſuch as leſs than Cherubims con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing in the fleſh? Is any Oratory more pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and raviſhing, than the meditation of God in his divine perfections, communicating himſelf to us fully and freely in the beſt way through his Son? Is any zeal more commendable than that which is ſpent in conſuming the luſts of thy own heart? Or any deſires more juſtifiable than the pantings and thirſtings for him that thirſted after our thirſt? Or doth any time run off more ſmoothly, and which thou canſt reflect upon the ſpending of with more comfort, and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, than that which is ſpent in ſuch holy flights of the ſoul? O bleſſed work and employment, and happy are thoſe ſouls that do continually live in it.</p>
            <p>In this ſweet, and bleſſed work, was this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Author much employed. Some taſtes of which are here offered to thee, though but a
<pb facs="tcp:64536:6"/> part of what he intended, <hi>ten Decads</hi> at leaſt being what he had propoſed to tender to publick view, but God took him to himſelf before he had compleated them.</p>
            <p>The other part is but a begun Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Wiles of Satan, I may ſay but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, for where the Author gave it his laſt hand, thou ſhalt find an Advertiſement in the reading of it. It being made up out of ſome Notes of his own, as will appear to the Judicious; it is the ſame thread, but the tying it in knots is ſome diſadvantage; yet as in an Organ or Virginal, the Pipes and Strings are not of the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or dimenſion, yet all ſerve to make the melody. So thoſe ſhort and little heads compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of the Authors materials, will I hope make the work ſomewhat harmonious, though it is every way ſhort of what it ſhould have been, had the ſame hand that began it finiſhed it. A work it is however of very great concernment, and every way becoming a Miniſter, and a Chriſtian, to underſtand his Enemy, to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Art, and Policy, to unmaske and bring this great Deceiver into open view, <hi>Ut praemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niti, ſimus praemuniti,</hi> being fore-warned, we may be fore-armed. The thoughts of this good man were much upon this ſubject, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency to his Lord and Maſters end of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the world, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that he might looſen,
<pb facs="tcp:64536:7"/> or diſſolve the works of the Devil; and he the rather revived this work now, which he had ſeveral years ago diſcourſed of, not only becauſe he found himſelf more improved, and fitted for it; but becauſe he ſaw the neceſſity of the Church required it. The ſpirit and courage of Chriſtians being almoſt ſpent in inteſtine quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and broyls, they needed the alarm of this common enemy, to reduce them to order, and unity; and ſome demonſtrations of his craft, in endeavouring to do that by policy, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand devices, he could never effect above board with all his power and ſtrength.</p>
            <p>But before I cloſe this Preface, I cannot but ſpeak a few words of the Author, Dr. <hi>William Spurſtow,</hi> who as he lived beloved of his friends, ſo he died of all his friends much lamented, not ſo much for their own, as the Publick loſs of him, being a perſon of ſuch an excellent ſpirit, that he was many waies uſeful, and ſerviceable. I ſhall not ſay any thing of his abilities of mind and judgement, ſince it appears by thoſe things extant of his, that he was none of thoſe <hi>Praeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia ingenia, Apuleius</hi> ſpeaks of. Thoſe rathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe Wits, as one calls them, that are fair in the bloſſom, but fail in the fruit. But he held ſuch an excellent tenour in his Miniſterial labours, that the more wiſe and judicious any were, the more they were delighted in him, and cleaved to him.
<pb facs="tcp:64536:7"/> But there were ſome graces in him in higher and more eminent degree, that may ſpeak him an example to us that ſurvive. Such were:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> His profound, and real humility, and that is a root-grace that hath many in it; and this is the true aſcenſion of the ſoul: For as the firſt ſtep downward was by Pride, ſo the firſt ſtep to heaven is by Humility. And as man did deſcend in aſcending to be like God, ſo we aſcend in deſcending to be like Chriſt in Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. This was the glory of this Author, though he had ſingular worth, yet he alwaies expreſt a ſingular humility, not only in denying thoſe things, which ordinarily men make the fuel to pride, none of which he wanted, but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending to thoſe of low degree, if he might but be ſerviceable to them. Which was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in that freedom of acceſs, and converſe with thoſe, between him and whom there was otherwiſe a great diſparity, eſpecially in that humbleneſs of mind he ſhewed after any large receits, or performances, wherein he ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf like <hi>Moſes,</hi> though his face ſhone he knew it not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> His Charity both in giving and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, the latter of which, as it is moſt noble, ſo it is the moſt difficult, and that which is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to Chriſt Diſciples. As for the former,
<pb facs="tcp:64536:8"/> though the World might expect more viſible and pompous demonſtrations of it, yet that charity is beſt, which, like the waters of <hi>Shiloh,</hi> run ſoftly, and the more private in this caſe the better. Our Saviour would have our good works ſhine, and not blaze. Now, that he was not deficient in this, may appear in that he was no hoarder, nor left he any Sums behind him; by which it appears plainly, that he lived to the utmoſt (if not beyond) the extent of his In-come, which alſo in vulgar eſtimation was double to the reality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To this may be added his Meekneſs, and Patience, the natural reſult of Humility, in which graces he was eminent, being ſeldom or never tranſported by paſſion, or if at any time thoſe paſſions which do repugn that grace did ariſe, they ſoon had a counterbuff from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine principle was in him. He alwaies had an innocent, and grateful chearfulneſs in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, that rendred it very acceptable, being very free from that moroſity of ſpirit which many times is like a cloud in a Diamond, and like a Curtain before a Picture. And yet as the ſweeteſt Roſe hath its prickles, and the induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bee (that makes the healing and mollifying Honey and Wax) her ſting: So he had a ſting of holy Zeal, which wiſdom had the conduct of, that it was not put forth upon every trivial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation;
<pb facs="tcp:64536:8"/> he knew when, and where, and how far to ſhew it; and in Gods Cauſe his Zeal was better tempered, than, like a brittle blade, to fly in ſhivers, and wound by-ſtanders; but it was true mettal, and would cut deep, ſo as to leave impreſſions behind it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Add to this his peaceable diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a great ornament to Chriſtianity. It was his principle, and practice, not to have that by contention he might have by peace; and for peace ſake, though he durſt not ſell the truth, yet he did often <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He loved thoſe of a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſpirit, and was grieved at the contrary ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and practice in any, though his friends. He did heartily bewail our diviſions; and how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous he was to obey thoſe commands of the Pſalmiſt and the Apoſtles, <hi>Purſue peace, enſue peace,</hi> noting both the vehemency and ſwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tneſs of the proſecution. If ſome did know, they would not, it may be, be ſatisfied; and if others did know, they would, it may be, be offended, and therefore it is beſt to leave that to him whoſe judgement is according to truth. But I remember I am to write a Preface, not a Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of his life. He was a lover of goodmen. Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and faithful in his Relations; a good Child,
<pb facs="tcp:64536:9"/> a good Father, a good Husband, a good Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a good Maſter, a good Neighbour, a good Friend, a good Governour, a good Subject, a good Miniſter; and all becauſe he was a good Chriſtian. He was full of heavenly Ejaculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, contented and patient under the loſs of his deſired Relations. And as they ſay the Swan ſings ſweetly before his death: So was his heart, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near his change, full of thankfulneſs, being like a Veſſel that wanted vent. For being gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly preſerved in the Viſitation, and reſtored to his friends, he expreſſed in all his Converſes with them, a deep ſence of Gods mercy, and a fear leaſt we ſhould ſoon forget it, and grow cold in our returns of praiſe, and obedience; and therefore did adviſe that we would become Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors to one another, and call upon one another not to forget that God who had ſo eminently preſerved us. Thus was the bleſſed Spirit of God tuning him for eternal praiſes, and winding his heart up to that ſweet and heavenly work, it pleaſed God by a ſhort and ſweet paſſage to take him unto. His death was not ſo much ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, as ſpeedy. Sudden death is evil, when death finds a man unprepared, but ſpeedy death is a great mercy. The <hi>Prodromi</hi> and Harbingers of death being many times more terrible than death; which made a good man ſay, <hi>I bleſs God I fear not death, yet I dare not ſay but I fear dying</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64536:9"/> Meaning, that the beſt Chriſtians have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of nature in them. The Jews, among the ſeveral waies of dying they reckon up, ſay, that of <hi>Moſes</hi> is the beſt, who died at the mouth of the Lord, God took away his ſoul with a kiſs. Yet Cenſorious Worldlings are ready to make ſtrange gloſſes, and comments upon ſuch paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of providence, which it would become them rather with a holy ſilence to adore, than with a bold curioſity to pry into. Let them remember that known ſaying, <hi>Qualis vita, finis it a,</hi> He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have an ill death, that leads a good life. I would therefore exhort thee, and all others, ſo to live, that we may have that <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>VVHen <hi>Cicero</hi> was asked which of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> his Orations he thought <hi>beſt,</hi> he wittily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, the <hi>longeſt.</hi> But, if the queſtion ſhould be, which of Prayers are the beſt, the anſwer then muſt not be, the <hi>longeſt,</hi> but the <hi>ſtrongeſt:</hi> not the Prayer that <hi>exceeds</hi> in <hi>quantity,</hi> but that which <hi>excells</hi> in <hi>qualli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> In Morall actions the Manner of working is a Swaying Circumſtance; a Man may ſin in doing good, but not in doing well: how few then are there which manage this duty of holy Prayer aright? Some miſtake the Language of Prayer, and think it conſiſts of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe then the cloathing of their meaning in apt expreſſions, with a tuneable delivery of it: Others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that if neceſſity have put an edge upon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and ſtirred up ſome paſſions of Self-love, that they cannot fail of acceptance. Others again put much in the length of their Prayers, meaſuring them by the <hi>time</hi> which is ſpent, rather then by the <hi>intention</hi> which is exerciſed in them. But alaſs, how wide are all ſuch apprehenſions from the truth? and how fruitleſs will ſuch duties be to thoſe that are no otherwiſe buſied in them? The Prayer, which is as delightful Muſick in Gods Eares, is not that which hath the quaint Note of the <hi>Nightingale,</hi> but that which hath the mournful Tones of the <hi>Dove.</hi> Broken ſighs and groans are the beſt Eio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence with God, and become Prayer; as unexpected <hi>stops</hi> and <hi>reſts</hi> (made by Muſicians) do grace the Muſick with a kind of Harmonical <hi>Apoſiopeſis,</hi> or <hi>Elipſis;</hi> it is not the Prayer that <hi>Indigency</hi> and natural <hi>deſires</hi> do
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64536:22"/> ſharpen, but which the <hi>Spirit</hi> doth enliven that is prevalent with God. The one is as the <hi>cry</hi> of the young <hi>Ravens,</hi> and the other is as the <hi>voice</hi> of <hi>Children</hi> that are taught to cry <hi>Abba,</hi> Father. It is not the many words of a proud <hi>Phariſee</hi> that obtain the bleſſing, but the pit by and ſhort Confeſſion of a penitent <hi>Publican,</hi> who is ſent away juſtified. <hi>Ah Father!</hi> may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be more effectual with God, who ſearcheth the hearts, and knoweth the mind of the Spirit, than a prayer that is ſtretched forth like an Evening ſhadow to a wonderful length. The one, though it be ſhort, may, like a ſmall <hi>figure</hi> in a Number, ſtand for much: and the other, though great, like a volume of <hi>Cyphers,</hi> may ſignifie nothing. Let therefore ſuch who are frequent in the duty of prayer, eſpecially <hi>young Converts,</hi> who are apt to think above what is meet of their own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements, endeavour to turn their <hi>length</hi> into <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and to remember that there is a wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>gift</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> of prayer, and that it is one thing to have <hi>Commerce</hi> with God in duties, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have <hi>Communion</hi> with him; The one is ſuch which ſtrangers may have in their mutual traffick, but the other is proper to friends, who are knit together in love.</p>

               <head>Meditation XIII. Vpon the Morning Dew.</head>
               <p>THe Meditation of this Subject is no leſs facile than delightful, like <hi>Jacobs</hi> Veniſon, it is ſoon come by, becauſe God hath brought it to my hand,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64536:22"/> having often in his Word reſembled the <hi>Dew,</hi> (which makes the earth fruitful,) <hi>to his Grace,</hi> that makes the hearts of men, naturally barren, to bring forth fruits of righteouſneſs; ſo that it is no difficult task for to draw an uſeful parallel between the one and the other in ſundry reſpects.</p>
               <p>The Dew is of an <hi>heavenly original,</hi> the nativity thereof is from the womb of the Morning, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>arrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the Sons of men. And is it not thus in the grace of Converſion? Is not that wholly from above, without any Preparations, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruities, Concurrencies, that do or can ariſe from the fleſh? We are made <hi>active</hi> by grace, but we are not at all <hi>Agents</hi> in fitting our ſelves for Grace. As no man can be antecedently active to his <hi>firſt</hi> birth; ſo neither can he be to his <hi>ſecond</hi> birth: Of Gods own Will we are begotten by the Word of Truth.</p>
               <p>The Dew alſo in its deſcent and fall is ſilent and imperceptible, it flies every ſenſe of which it may ſeem to be a proper object. It is ſo ſubtle, as that the ſharpeſt eye cannot ſee it; ſo ſilent, as that the quickeſt ear cannot hear it; and ſo thin, as that the naked hand cannot feel it. When it is come it is viſible, but how it comes who can tell? After ſuch a ſecret manner oft times are the illapſes of the Spirit, and the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his grace upon the heart; his <hi>Teachings,</hi> his <hi>Tractions,</hi> his <hi>Callings</hi> are all efficacious to <hi>draw,</hi> to <hi>perſwade,</hi> yet the way is hidden, and the ſoul, ere ever it is aware, is made like the Chariots of <hi>Aminadab.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Dew again, as <hi>Naturaliſts</hi> obſerve, is moſt abounding in calm and ſerene ſeaſons, when the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are leaſt diſturbed with winds and ſtorms; <hi>Ros eſt humidum quid è ſerenitate concretum minutatim labens;</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:64536:23"/> it is a moyſture drawn up by the Sun in the day, and then falling by ſmall innumerable drops in the night. And is it not thus in the grace of God? Are not thoſe hearts refreſhed moſt with it, that are leaſt diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted with Earthly Cares, and toſſed too and fro with Anxieties? Are not ſuch, like <hi>Gideons</hi> Fleece, plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wet with the Evidences of Gods love, when others, like the ground about it, are wholly dry?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Dew is of a growing and reviving na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which brings a life and verdure to Fields, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, Gardens, Flowers, which the cold would chill, or the heat would ſcorch. Therefore when God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>Iſrael</hi> the beauty of the <hi>Lilly,</hi> the ſtability of the <hi>Ced<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Who can but love him with a love of <hi>duty,</hi> whom he ſhall thus tender with a love of <hi>mercy?</hi> Who can but love him with a love of <hi>Concupiſcence,</hi> as being more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of new <hi>Influences,</hi> than ſatisfied with former <hi>Receipts,</hi> whom he ſo freely loves with a love of <hi>Beneficence?</hi> O Lord, my Soul thirſteth for thee as the gaping and chapped earth doth for the moyſture of the Heavens; I am nothing, I can do nothing without thee; my <hi>fruitfulneſs,</hi> my <hi>growth,</hi> my <hi>life</hi> depend wholly upon the droppings of thy grace; when they dew lieth all night upon my Branch, my glory is freſh in me, and my whole man is as the ſmell of a field which the Lord hath bleſſed. Be not therefore unto me. O my God, as a Cloud without Rain, left I be as a Tree without fruit. But let thy grace alwaies diſtill upon me as the dew, and as the ſmall rain upon the tender herb, and

Or that blindneſs which is cauſed by a <hi>Pearl in the Eye,</hi> is more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table than the loſs of ſight that comes by other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents? Methinks Reaſon ſhould not run at ſo low an ebb in any, as to pleaſe themſelves in ſuch fancies; may not a <hi>Poyſon</hi> have a <hi>name</hi> that ſounds better to the ear; a <hi>colour</hi> more pleaſing to the eye, and a taſte that is more grateful to the Pallate, than the <hi>Antidote</hi> which expels it? May not <hi>Alchimy</hi> gliſter when <hi>Gold</hi> looks pale? And yet alas! in ſpiritual maladies, in which the danger is ſo much the greater by how much the ſoul is of more value than the body; with what ſtrange deluſions are many tranſported? who when their minds are poyſoned with Errour and Blaſphemy,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64536:24"/> do then put upon their corrupt Opinions and Tenents, the glorious names of <hi>Revelations, Viſions, Raptures, refined notions,</hi> and what not, that may confirm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their own dotages, and win others into an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of their perſons. Thus <hi>Montanus</hi> gave out himſelf to be the <hi>Comforter</hi> that Chriſt had promiſed to ſend forth into the World. <hi>Arius</hi> proudly boaſted, that God had revealed ſomething to him, which he hid from his Apoſtles. And <hi>Eunomius</hi> fondly imagined that he was taken up to Heaven, as <hi>Elias</hi> was; and had ſeen Gods face, as had <hi>Moſes,</hi> and was wrapt up to the third heaven, as was <hi>Paul.</hi> But what other thing are theſe Follies, or rather Phrenſys, than as if an <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael te</hi> infected with the botch of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and overſpread with it from the ſole of the foot to the crown of the head, ſhould boaſt that he had robbed the <hi>Egyptians</hi> of their moſt precious Jewels, and had decked him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with them? Would not men pitty his diſtemper, rather than believe his confidence? Would not they offer medicines to heal him, rather than ſuffer him to periſh under his miſerable deluſion of poſſeſſing great riches? How is it then that in matters of faith, in which there is both clear evidence and certainty, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, that are no other than ulcerous perſons, fitter for. Dogs to lick than Chriſtians to love, ſhould through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Ages ſo eaſily gain to themſelves ſuch a great multitude of Proſelytes only by putting fair Names up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on foul Errours? It is becauſe men for their luſts ſake will not ſee, but willingly corrupt themſelves in thoſe things which they know? or is it becauſe God hath ſmitten them with a ſpirit of blindneſs that they ſhall not ſee, for their not receiving of the truth in the love of it? Surely, whatever the cauſe be, ſuch is the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, as that I had need both to <hi>tremble,</hi> and to

               <p>THe ſoul hath its maladies, as well as the body; and ſuch that for their likeneſs to them, do often borrow their names from them. <hi>Pride,</hi> is a <hi>Timpany; Avarice,</hi> a <hi>Dropſie; Security,</hi> a <hi>Lithargy; Luſt,</hi> a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenture; Apoſtacy,</hi> an <hi>Epilepſie.</hi> And yet (though theſe names of <hi>bodily</hi> diſeaſes do happily ſerve to point and ſhadow out the nature of <hi>ſpiritual)</hi> how wide is the difference between the Patients of the one and of the other, in regard of thoſe qualities which may diſpoſe them for a cure and recovery out of them? In the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the body it matters not whether the Patient know the name of his diſeaſe, or underſtand the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the medicines which are preſcribed, or be able to judge of the <hi>increaſe, height,</hi> and <hi>declination</hi> of his diſtempers by the beatings of his pulſe; the whole buſineſs is managed by the care and wiſdom of the Phyſician, who oft times conceals the danger on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe leaſt <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>fancy</hi> ſhould work more than his Phyſick, and hinder the benefit of what he applies. But in the maladies of the ſoul it is far otherwiſe; the firſt ſtep unto ſpiritual health is a diſtinct and clear
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64536:25"/> inſight of ſin, ſuch which makes men to underſtand the Plague of their own hearts; Chriſt heals by <hi>light,</hi> as well as by <hi>Influence;</hi> he firſt <hi>Convinceth</hi> them of ſin, and then gives the <hi>pardon,</hi> he diſcovers the <hi>diſeaſe</hi> to them, and then adminiſters the <hi>medicine.</hi> Ignorance is a bar to the welfare of the ſoul, though not of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and makes the divine remedies to have as little effect upon it, as Purges or Cordials have upon the Glaſſes into which they are put. It is <hi>Solomons</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory Concluſion, that a ſoul without knowledge is not good, nor indeed can be, becauſe it wants a principle, which is as neceſſary to goodneſs as a viſive power to the eye to enable it to diſcern its object. How can he ever value holineſs who underſtands not what ſin is? Or deſire a Saviour who hath no ſence of his need? O therefore, bleſſed Lord, do thou dayly more open my eyes, that I may ſee my ſelf to be among the <hi>ſinzers,</hi> and not among the <hi>righteous;</hi> among the <hi>ſick,</hi> and not among the <hi>whole;</hi> that ſo I may be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by thee, who cameſt not to <hi>call</hi> the righteous, but ſinners to repentance; nor to <hi>ſave</hi> the whole, but the ſick.

               <p>SUch is the diſparity between a <hi>Lamp</hi> and a <hi>Star,</hi> as that happily it may not a little be wondred at, why I ſhould make a joynt Meditation of them which are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64536:25"/> ſo greatly diſtant in reſpect of <hi>place,</hi> and far more in reſpect of <hi>quality,</hi> the one being an <hi>earthly,</hi> and the other an <hi>heavenly</hi> body. What is a <hi>Lamp</hi> to a <hi>Star</hi> in regard of <hi>influence, duration,</hi> or <hi>beauty?</hi> Hath it any quickning raies flowing from it? Or is its light im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, ſo as not to become deſpiſed by expiring? Can it dazle the beholder with its ſerene luſtre, and leave ſuch impreſſions of it ſelf upon the eye, as may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it for a time blind to any other objects? Alas! theſe are too high and noble effects for ſuch a feeble and uncertain light to produce, and proper only to thoſe glorious bodies that ſhine in the Firmament. But yet this great inequallity between the one and the other ſerves to make them both more meet Emblems of the differing eſtate of Believers in this and the other life, who in Scripture, while they are on this ſide Heaven, are compared to wiſe Virgins with <hi>Lamps burning,</hi> and when they come to Heaven, to <hi>Stars ſhining,</hi> which endure for ever and ever. Grace in the beſt of Saints is not perfect, but muſt, like a Lamp, be fed with new ſupplies that it go not our, and be often <hi>trimmed</hi> that it be not dim. Ordinances are as neceſſary to Chriſtians in this life as <hi>Manna</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the wilderneſs though in <hi>Canaan</hi> it ceaſed; And therefore, God hath appointed his Word and Sacraments to drop continually upon the hearts of his Children, as the two Olive trees upon the golden Candleſtick. What mean then thoſe fond conceits of <hi>perfectists,</hi> who dream of living above all ſubſidiary helps, and judge Ordinances as uſeleſs to them, as oyl for a Star, or a ſnuffing of the Sun to make it ſhine more bright? It is true, when we come to heaven ſuch things will be of no more uſe to our ſouls, than meat or drink will be to our bodies; but yet while we

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64536:26"/>

And yet what other thing is intended by them than to make up the outſide of a Prayer? Theſe ſins are only placed in it, as dark ſhadows in a Picture to ſet it off with more advantage, and to commend it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to men than to God. In the doing of the duty they think not in the leaſt the worſe of themſelves for what they ſay againſt themſelves, nor would have others ſo to do; elſe how comes it to paſs, that in charging themſelves ſo deeply at Gods Tribunal, there is as little appearance of ſhame or ſorrow in their face, as there was of a Cloud in the Heavens when <hi>Elijahs</hi> Servant returned this Anſwer, that there was nothing?

               <p>IT is a Truth, though it hath been queſtioned by ſome, and denied by others, that the <hi>Function</hi> of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is Formally executed by Gifts, which are not made effectual by his <hi>Perſonal Sanctity,</hi> but by the <hi>grace</hi> of God in the hearer.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64536:30"/> he not do what he Teacheth, and ſecond his Doctrine with his Example: he muſt needs ſin againſt his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which alwayes heightneth the notoriety of the fact. No ſins being ſo inexcuſably ſinfull, as thoſe that are committed againſt Mens Callings: For a <hi>Steward</hi> to be a Thief, for a <hi>Phyſician</hi> to be a <hi>Murderer,</hi> for an <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> truſted with the Affairs of his Prince to be a <hi>Traitour,</hi> are Crimes of greater Infamy in them then in another. How then can the impieties of a Miniſter but be above all others, by ſo much the worſt, by how much his Calling is above all others the beſt? what then can be more prodigious, then for him, who ſhould be Gods Mouth to the People, to have his Tongue ſet on Fire of Hell, and not touched with a Coal from the Altar? or for him whom God hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with that high imployment of winning Souls, to be an accurſed Appollyon in undoing and deſtroying them by his nefarious and impure living: If he that ſhall break the leaſt Commandment, and Teach Men ſo, ſhall be called leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven, what then ſhall he be called who breaks the greateſt Commandment, and Teacheth Men ſo? ſurely I ſcarce know what to call him, who hath of a <hi>Minister</hi> thus transformed himſelf into a Monſter, he is not a <hi>Star</hi> in Chriſts <hi>right hand,</hi> but in the <hi>Dragons Tail,</hi> which drew many from Heaven and caſt them down upon the Earth. He is amongſt the Prophets, the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> rightly called <hi>Niger,</hi> not for his <hi>Complexion,</hi> but for his <hi>Converſation:</hi> he is in the Houſe and Temple of God, not as the Prieſts which did bear the Ark, but as the Beaſts which drew it and ſhook it. For, if the ſins of any Man do looſen and endanger the Foundations of Chriſtian Religion, it is the wickedneſs of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which makes many to queſtion whether there be

But though evil in thoſe who are in <hi>high places</hi> be more <hi>infectious,</hi> and the good more powerful than it is in others; yet the vices of thoſe who are in a lower Station have a tendency to corrupt the greateſt, as the head in the body natural is oft diſtempered by the feet. And ſo the vertues that are in them are alſo operative to influence thoſe that are in dignity above them, to the making of themſelves evil, if not more good. The luſtre of St. <hi>Johns</hi> Sanctity, though cloathed with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels hair, extorts reverence from <hi>Herod</hi> in his Robes; and <hi>Pauls</hi> excellent demeanour of himſelf at the Bar, well-nigh overcomes <hi>Agrippa</hi> upon the Bench to be a Chriſtian. O how careful then ſhould every man be, who in what condition ſoever he ſtands is a part of the body of humane ſociety, <hi>to abhor evil, and to cleave to that which is good?</hi> When the effects both of the one and other are not terminated in our ſelves, but do more or leſs benefit or hurt others as well as our ſelves.</p>

               <p>WHat a vain and fictitious happineſs would that be, if a poor man, who had only a ſmall piece of money, ſhould, by the looking upon it through a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying Glaſs, pleaſe himſelf in believing that he is now ſecure from the fears of preſſing wants, his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle piece being ſuddenly minted into many pounds, with which he can readily furniſh himſelf with fuell to warm him, cloaths to cover him, and food to ſatisfie him? But alas! when he puts forth his hand to take a ſupply from what he beholds, he can feel nothing of what he ſees; and when the Glaſs is gone that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with ſo much Treaſure, he can then ſee nothing but his firſt pittance, which alſo becomes the leſs deſirable becauſe of the diſappointment of his hopes. Upon what better foundation doth the felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the greateſt part of men ſtand, which is not fixed upon any true and ſpiritual good, as its proper <hi>Baſis,</hi> but upon the ſpecious ſemblances of a corrupt and mutable fancy? What is it that rich men do not promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who conceive riches to be a ſtrong Tower? They think they can laugh at Famine, and when others, like the poor <hi>Egyptians,</hi> whoſe Subſtance is exhauſted, ſell themſelves and their children for food, they can buy their bread at any rate. If Enemies riſe up againſt them, they queſtion not, but they can purchaſe a peace or a victory. If Sickneſs come, oh how can they pleaſe themſelves in thinking that their Purſe can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64536:34"/> the Phyſicians skill, and the Drugſters ſhops.

Surely the tranſient ſparks that with much difficulty are forced from the flint, may as ſoon add light to the body of the Sun, as Riches can yield any ſolid comfort to the ſoul, or keep it from lying down in the bed of darkneſs and ſorrow. Away then from me ye flattering vanities and gilded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things of the world, get you to the Bats, and to the Moles, and try what beauteous rayes you can dart into their eyes.

               <p>THe <hi>Stoick</hi> Philoſophy was famous for <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> ſtrange Opinions, improbable, and beſides com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conceit, for which it was much admired by ſome, and as greatly controuled, and taxed by others. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, not <hi>Stoiciſme only,</hi> but every Art, and courſe of life and learning hath ſome <hi>Paradoxes</hi> or other, but Chriſtianity hath many more, which ſeem like no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than truth, and yet are as true as ſtrange. What can be more contrary to the Principles and <hi>Maxims</hi> of Philoſophers, than to hold that there is a regreſs from a total privation to an habit? It was that which the <hi>Epicureans</hi> and <hi>Stoicks</hi> derided in <hi>Paul,</hi> when he preached the Reſurrection from the dead; and yet Chriſtians build all their happineſs and confidence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. What can ſeem to carry more of a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in it than that ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>He that will loſe his life ſhall find it?</hi> And yet it is a truth of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that whoſoever follows not Chriſts counſell
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64536:35"/> will certainly miſs of life. What will happily appear more novel and ſtrange, than that which I ſhall now adde by inverting the common Axiom, and affirming this as a truth, <hi>Levia tendunt deorſum, &amp; gravia ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi> Light things fall downwards, and heavy aſcend upwards: The lighter they are the lower they ſink, and the heavier they are the higher they riſe; and yet this Riddle hath a truth in it. In Scripture the wicked that muſt fall as low as hell are reſembled to things of the greateſt <hi>Levity</hi> as well as vileneſs, <hi>Duſt, Chaff, Smoke, Fume, Scum:</hi> and the Saints that muſt aſcend as high as Heaven, are likened to things of weight as well as worth: To <hi>Wheat,</hi> the heavieſt of which is the beſt; to <hi>Gold,</hi> which is of Metals the weightieſt, as well as the richeſt; to <hi>Gems</hi> and precious Stones. that are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued by the number of the <hi>Carrats</hi> which they weigh, as well as by their luſtre with which they ſparkle. Yea, God hath his <hi>Ballance</hi> to weigh men and their actions, as well as his Touchſtone to try them. He is a God of knowledge, by whom actions are weighed, ſaith <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> in her Song: And if he find great men a lye and vanity upon the Ballance he will not ſpare them. What a ſevere Judgment did God execute upon <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar,</hi> who being weighed and found wanting, was in the ſame night caſt out both from his Kingdom, and from the Land of the living? And what a dreadful Sentence hath Chriſt foretold ſhall come from his mouth in the great day againſt thoſe who have made a vain and empty profeſſion of his Name, who are bid to depart from him, and go accurſed into everlaſting fire, not for doing evil againſt his, but for not doing of good unto them? A form of Godlineſs without the power will condemn, as well as real and open wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: To be found too light in Gods Scale may be a

O remember who hath ſaid it, Except your righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of <hi>Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of heaven. How gladly then would I perſwade Chriſtians, that the beſt way to climbe the <hi>Jacobs Ladder,</hi> which hath its foot on Earth, and its top in glory, is to be fully laden with all fruits of holineſs. <hi>Chriſti ſarcina pennas habet non pondus,</hi> the burden of Chriſt is not a preſſing weight, but a winged thing which carries the Soul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and helps it to ſoar aloft towards God himſelf.

               <p>THe fruition of the end, is the Sabbath of all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, having this property in it, to <hi>quiet</hi> as well as <hi>incite</hi> the <hi>Agent;</hi> for nothing moves that it may move, but moves that it may reſt. And yet though the end be alwaies deſirable, it is by Agents who act freely, and out of choice often miſſed, and falls ſhort of, as well as enjoyed. And this ſometimes comes to paſs by their dividing the means from the end, preſuming they may obtain the one, and yet not uſe the other. With this Sophiſm Satan hath cheated many of Salvation, while he hath made them confident of happineſs, and yet careleſs of holineſs; and to think they may Inne with the righteous, though they never travel with
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64536:36"/> them in the way, that they may reap glory, though they ſow ſeed to the fleſh. Sometimes again they miſs the end though they uſe the means, becauſe they do not proportion the one to the other. They uſe the means, but it is, as ſome Patients take Phyſick, to ſtir the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours rather than to carry them away, and thereby endanger themſelves, rather than effect a cure. Many through the ſtrength of Conviction yield that if they will have heaven ſomething muſt be done by them; but their ſtudy is rather to find out the <hi>inviſible point,</hi> where nature and grace part, than to abound in all manner of holy Converſation, and ſo while they ſtrive to do no more then what will ſave them, they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably fall ſhort of what is requiſite. Others again miſcarry in regard of the end, by pitching upon falſe and vain means, ſuch when laboured and perſiſted in do not profit in the leaſt. Would any man wonder at his diſappointment, that ſhould hunt an Hare with a Snail? Or to hit the Mark ſhould ſhoot an Arrow out of a Butchers Gambrel? Or to make a Tree fruitful ſhould cloath the body of it with coſtly Silks inſtead of feeding the root with good mould? Would not this folly be rather greatly reproached by all, then his fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated endeavours in the leaſt be pitied by any? And yet how many men who would brand ſuch a perſon with the deepeſt mark of folly and madneſs are guilty of as great infatuation in matters of far higher moment? Is there any thing that can be of more real conſequence, than the eternal welfare of an immortal ſoul? Can the care of Anxiety be too great what Rocks to ſhun; what paths to tread; what means to uſe, that may bring the ſoul and ſalvation together? And yet behold what an ill choice of <hi>Mediums</hi> do ſuch who profeſs themſelves wiſe make to effect it: The <hi>Idolater,</hi> he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64536:36"/> after a ſtrange manner firſt makes his God, and then begs his happineſs from it; one part of the Wood he burnes, as Fuel to ſerve him, and the other part of it he ſerves and dreads as a Deity, and falling down unto it, worſhippeth it, and ſaith, deliver me for thou art my God. The wretched <hi>Libertine</hi> he thinks it little skills what Religion any man is of, ſo he be but true unto it, and walk according to the Rules and Principles of it: as if Heaven were a Port to which all Windes would drive; an Inn in which Travellers that journey from contrary quarters may be equally received. The <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical Chriſtian</hi> layes the ſtreſs of his Salvation upon his Duties, which at beſt are like chaines of glaſs, more ſpecious then ſtrong; like flouriſhings in Parchment, that cannot bear a fiery trial. O how few are they who conſider that Heaven ſtands like a little Mark in a wide Field, where there are a thouſand wayes to erre from it, and but one to hit it? yea, though God hath ſaid that there is but <hi>one Sacrifice</hi> by which we can be perfected; but <hi>one Blood</hi> by which we can be Purified; but <hi>one Name</hi> by which we can be ſaved; yet how hardly are the beſt drawn to truſt perfectly to the Grace revealed, and to look from themſelves to Chriſt, as the Author and Finiſher of their bleſſedneſs? To make them a right choice of the way that leads to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not an act of Natural Wiſdom, but of Divine Illumination, and Teachings of the Spirit, who both inlightneth the Minde, and inclineth the will to chuſe the one thing which is neceſſary. O therefore, holy Father, ſeeing thou haſt made the whole Progreſs of Salvation, from firſt to laſt to be in Chriſt, and by Chriſt; <hi>Election</hi> to be in him, <hi>Adoption</hi> to be in him, <hi>Juſtification</hi> to be in him, <hi>Sanctification</hi> to be in him, <hi>Glorification</hi> to be in him; grant, that whatever others

The Fire at the ſame time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the three Children in the Furnace, and devours
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64536:37"/> the Inſtruments of their Perſecution: The Red-Sea is <hi>Iſraels</hi> Path to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Waters a Wall on each hand, but both are made the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> grave: The Earth opens her Mouth to ſwallow up <hi>Corah</hi> and his Company, but it helpes the <hi>Woman</hi> in her flight by opening its mouth to drink in the Flood, which the Dragon ſent forth from his Mouth to deſtroy Her. The Trees of the Field fight for <hi>David,</hi> and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to his Victory more than his Army; for it is ſaid that the Wood deſtroyed more than the Sword: An Oak Arreſts <hi>Abſolom</hi> in his flight, who is caught and hanged in it, as if it would point out what was the juſt reward of his Treaſon and Rebellion againſt his King and Father; But an Oak ſuccours our <hi>Prince</hi> in his retreat from the ſtrength and power of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Enemy; and though it can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Who then would not Adore and Fear ſuch a God, at whoſe Beck, <hi>Fire, Water, Trees of the Field,</hi> yea and all Creatures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Enemies, or Friends, as he pleaſeth to make them.</p>
               <p>A ſecond ſtep is the conſideration of Gods abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Soveraignty over all Potentates, and Kings of the Earth; who, as <hi>Elihu</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>Breaketh in pieces the Mighty without number, and ſets others in their ſtead.</hi> How full are the Sacred Chronicles of ſtrange

               <p>A third ſtep, or motion, diſcovers to us how eaſily God can hide Perſons and things from Man, when Man can neither hide Counſells from God, nor yet himſelf. <hi>Adam</hi> runs from God, and ſeeks ſhelter among the Trees of the Garden; but God findes him out: he ſowes Fig-leaves together to cover his Nakedneſs, but God eſpies it.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64536:38"/> behold him; nor the pitchy darkneſs of the Night make ſuch a Covering, as he cannot look through, to whom the darkneſs and the light are both alike. The onely way for a ſinner to hide himſelf from God, is to hide himſelf in God. But with what facility and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of wayes can God ſecure and keep thoſe whom Men deſign to deſtruction? <hi>David</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We read in <hi>Judges</hi> of an Angel that ſate under an <hi>Oak,</hi> and may we not well preſume, that this <hi>Oak,</hi> which had a Prince in the top of it, had alſo an <hi>Angel</hi> at the bottom of it, if we well weigh the Eminency of the deliverance.</p>
               <p>A fourth ſtep gives us to behold the rich Mercy, and the great Faithfulneſs of God, who though he doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, yet doth not forſake; who as he caſts down, ſo he raiſeth up: as he taketh away, ſo alſo he graciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. Was ever Prince reduced to ſorer ſtraits? Did he not at once conflict with dangers of Life, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, Baniſhment, diſappointment of Counſells, and a daily ſetting back of his hopes by new difficulties and emergences that did ariſe? and yet how wonderfully did God make theſe Mountaines to become a Plain; the confuſed noiſe of Warriours in Battel, was not heard, Garments rolled in Blood were not ſeen; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64536:39"/> were the Firr-trees terribly ſhaken in the Field; all was effected not by might nor power, but by the Spirit of God. The Temple, in which there was neither Hammer nor Axe, nor any Tool of Iron heard, was not built in a more calme and ſtill manner than his Throne was Erected. And he who was as a Stone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected for a long time, by certain Builders, at length became the Head-Stone of the Corner. May we not then well ſay this is the Lords doing, it is marvellous in our eyes? Let me therefore make here a pauſe, and in ſtead of a further progreſs, ſay as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, I will ſtand and ſee this great ſight, a Prince once diſguiſed in a poor and mean habit, and now clothed with Robes of Majeſty; once an Exile from three Kingdomes, and now poſſeſſing the juſt Royalties of them all. Once neceſſitated to climbe an <hi>Oak</hi> to preſerve his own life, and now daily aſcending the <hi>Throne</hi> to give out the Lawes of life and of death unto others. O what a web of wonders are here, of which God hath made garments of Praiſe and Salvation for him, whom ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny judged to be not onely ſmitten but forſaken of God? Admiration methinks now is better then words; and ſilence, in an awfull beholding of theſe things, is more expreſſive then a free ſpeaking of them. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore break off this Meditation, which I cannot happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly end, adding onely this ſhort Prayer, That the good will of him that dwelt in the <hi>Oak,</hi> as well as in the <hi>buſh,</hi> may ſtill be ſeen in the bleſſings that come from him, upon the Head of our <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and on the Crown of the Head of Him that was ſeparated from His Subjects, but is now wonderfully reſtored to them.</p>

But whoever he were, the Ointment is much famed (yet not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unqueſtioned) for its ſtrange manner of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and curing of wounds, differing from other Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall Applications in a double reſpect: The one is, that it is applyed not to the perſon who receives the wounds, but to the active Inſtrument that inflicts it, which is a ſubject not at all capable of ſickneſs, or ſanity, of eaſe or pain, and ſo cannot be recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the alterative power of the Oyntment, which, if it work by a vertual contact, muſt neceſſarily have the intermedial Bodies to participate of it. The other is, that this Salve effects its Cure at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which are inconſiſtent with the Rules of a mediate Contact, it heales the Patient when he is a hundred miles off, as well as when he is near; and that requires a vicinity of place, as well as a right diſpoſition of the <hi>Medium.</hi> Now theſe differences, though they have ſerved to heighten its eſteem in the apprehenſions of many, and have given occaſion to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64536:40"/> Learned Men, who are great admirers of <hi>Sympathies,</hi> to Write for it, or to be fautors of it; yet others of no leſs worth and repute have divided from them, and have ſlighted it as an empty vanity, or cenſured it as a Magical impiety. For my part I am not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with ſuch ſubtill nicities as are uſed to defend it, of common and univerſal Spirits, which convey the action of the remedy unto the part, and conjoyn the vertue of bodies far disjoyned, neither can I think it worthy of ſuch ſpeculations; it commonly heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but ſimple wounds, and ſuch, which being kept clean, need no other hand then that of Nature, and the Balſam of the proper part. But there is a Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Salve of which it is eaſie to ſpeak much, but Impoſſible to ſay enough; ſo full it is of divine and myſterious wonders, if we conſider either what it is, or what the cures are which it effects, or what the diſtance is in which it operates. Would you know what this <hi>Salve</hi> is? it is the Blood of Chriſt Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whoſe ſufferings do all turn to the advantage of Believers: the <hi>Blood</hi> is his, but the <hi>Balme</hi> is theirs; the <hi>Thornes</hi> are his, but the <hi>Crown</hi> is theirs; the <hi>Price</hi> is his, but the <hi>Purchaſe</hi> is theirs: Would you hear what Cures it doth? it healeth inveterate Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and mortal Wounds; it extinguiſheth the Fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Darts of Satan; it drawes forth the Venom of the Sting of Death; it eaſeth Preſſures; it deſtroyeth Yokes, and what not, that riſeth up as a let or barr 10 a Believers life or happineſs. Would you know the extent of its vertue, and at what a diſtance it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates? <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that by the Blood of his Croſs Chriſt hath reconciled all things unto himſelf, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be things in Earth, or things in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. There is no Perſon that can ſtand ſo remote,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64536:40"/> or be at any ſuch Angle; or Corner of the Earth, but he may partake of the influence of it, if he do but caſt up an eye of Faith towards Heaven, and be as fully healed as any other. Like as the ſtung <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite</hi> who lay in the utmoſt part of the Camp did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive equal benefit by looking to the Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, with him that ſtood next unto the Pole upon which it was Erected. O therefore let not any, who are excerciſed with Spiritual Conflicts caſt away their Confidence, but fight the good fight of Faith unto the end: for though they be not <hi>invulnerable,</hi> yet none of their Wounds are <hi>incurable.</hi> The Blood of Chriſt is more powerful to Save, than Sin, or other Enemies to Deſtroy; elſe the great end of Chriſts Coming into the World, of being a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to the Sick, a Deliverer to the Captive, an Healer of the Broken-Hearted would be in vain, and all the Saints muſt be ſtill in their Sins. Set then Faith on work ye that Faint and Droop in your Mindes; and ſay not, who ſhall go up for us to Heaven, and bring this Salve-unto us that we may liye? or who ſhall go over the Sea for us and bring this Soveraigne Balme of <hi>Gilead</hi> unto us, that we may be healed by it? Do but Believe and the Cure is wrought. Faith is the Inſtrument which makes a vertual Contact between Chriſt and every Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: It receives healing Grace from him, and ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes conveys it unto the Subject in which it is to terminate. For as Futurition in reſpect of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtency of things is no prejud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce to the Eye of Faith in the beholding of them as preſent; So neither is diſtance of place any hinderance to the efficacy of the touch of Faith, but that it may forthwith tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Sanative Efflux of Chriſts Blood unto him,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64536:41"/> who by Faith toucheth him: The Woman that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured many yeares of the Bloody Iſſue, in the ſame inſtant that She touched the Hem of Chriſts Garment, felt in her ſelf, that She was healed of her Plague. But I am jealous, that whileſt I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this ſacred remedy, ſome preſumptuous Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who is more apt to abuſe Grace, than a Wounded Spirit to improve it, ſhould make no other uſe of it than to think he may ſin ſecurely, and needs not fear what bruiſes and wounds he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, ſeeing the Cure is certain and ſpeedy. I can therefore do no leſs then expreſs my ſelf in an holy Indignation againſt ſuch, who would make the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood of my Saviour ſubſervient to their luſts, deſiring rather to be freed from the <hi>danger</hi> than from the <hi>Dominion</hi> of their ſins. <hi>O my Soul come not thou into their ſecret; unto their Aſſembly mine Honour be not thou united: Curſed be their luſts, for they are vile, and their deſires for they are devilliſh.</hi> Let me bleſs God who hath made me whole, <hi>and ſin no more, leaſt a worſe thing come unto me.</hi>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64536:41"/> they be ſo great, are driven of fierce winds, yet are turned about with a very ſmall Helm whitherſoever the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour liſteth.</hi> The right guidance of this ſingle part is of ſuch conſequence to the ſafety of the whole, as that every irregular motion may either hazard the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, or greatly hinder its progreſs, when it anſwereth not the juſt point of the Compaſs. How continually are theſe words of direction, <hi>Starboard, Starboard, Port, Port,</hi> ſpoken by him that eyes the <hi>Compaſs,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated by him that holds the <hi>Helm,</hi> to prevent all danger that might ariſe from miſtakes. Or elſe how ſuddenly would Rocks, Waves, or Sands make a prey of them? Well then might <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Mechanical Queſtions</hi> propoſe it as a Problem worthy of a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, why a little helm hanging upon the outmoſt part of the Ship, ſhould have ſuch a great power as to move a vaſt bulk and weight with much facility, amidſt ſtorms and guſts of wind? And may we not anſwer, that the wiſdom in theſe Arts is Gods, though the induſtry in the uſe of them is mans. But the more power it hath, the more apt Emblem it is of that faculty of the Will, which in all moral actions is the <hi>Spiritual Rudder</hi> of the ſoul, to turn the whole man this way or that way as it pleaſeth. The Poſition of the School is a truth, <hi>Inclinatio voluntatis eſt inclinatio totius compoſiti:</hi> The inclination of the will is the inclination of the whole perſon, and according to the rectitude, or pravity of its motions both the man and his actions are denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated good or evil. And hence it is that <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth often define Sin by a <hi>mala voluntas,</hi> and good by a <hi>bona voluntas,</hi> becauſe of the dominion which the Will hath in the whole man. Of how abſolute concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is it then, that this great Engine which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth all the inferiour powers of the ſoul, be not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64536:42"/> diſordered. If there be a <hi>Dyſpepſie</hi> in the Stomack, an <hi>inflamation</hi> in the Liver, or a taint in ſome other Vitall, what can the leſs noble parts of the body contribute unto its health? If the Foundation be out of courſe, how can the Building ſtand? If the Spring be polluted, who can expect the Streams ſhould be Chriſtalline? If the will be vitiated, how can it be, that Fear, Hatred, Love, Joy, Deſire, which in the <hi>ſenſitive</hi> part are <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> but in the <hi>ſoul</hi> are immaterial <hi>affections,</hi> or rather <hi>operations</hi> of the Will, and are found in Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſhould be pure and free from the corruption of their principle? It is therefore neceſſary that this <hi>ſpiritual Rudder</hi> have alſo a <hi>ſpiritual Compaſs</hi> by which it may ſteer, that ſo its motions may not be deſtructive, or at the leaſt vain. And what can this Compaſs be but the Word and Will of God? Conformity and obedience unto which is the only happineſs as well as the whole duty of man. It is mans duty to will what God wills, becauſe as he was made like unto God in his Image, ſo he was made for God in his end. And it is the happineſs of man to <hi>will</hi> and <hi>nill</hi> as God doth, becauſe he thereby only comes to obtain a true and perfect reſt: Elſe <hi>Seu caret optatis, ſeu fruitio miſer eſt;</hi> whether he have or want what he deſires, he is ſtill miſerable; like <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove, reſtleſs and fluttering till it can find out an object wherein it may acquieſce; Like the Grave and the Horſe-leech, alwaies craving and never ſatisfied. See then, O Chriſtian, from whence is it that this world, which is a tempeſtuous Sea unto all, proves ſo fatall to many in the ſad ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of their eternal happineſs. Is it not from the lawleſs motions of their will? which when not gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the will of God, as its perfect rule, is <hi>Cupiditas non voluntas,</hi> an impetuous and raging <hi>luſt</hi> rather than a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64536:42"/> 
                  <hi>will.</hi> What was it that ruined our firſt Parents, and in them all their Poſterity, but the inordinacy of their will; by which they loſt both their happineſs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs at once? And what is it under the Goſpel into which Chriſt reſolves the damnation of thoſe that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh? Is it not that they will not come unto him that they might have life? All obedience or diſobedience is properly, or at leaſt primarily in no part but in the will, ſo that though other faculties of the ſoul in rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration are ſanctified, and thereby made conformable to the will of God, yet obedience and diſobedience are formally acts of the will, and according to its quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications is a man ſaid to be obedient unto God or diſobedient. O that I could therefore awaken both my ſelf and others to a due conſideration of what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance it is, like a wiſe and induſtrious Pilot to guide this <hi>Rudder</hi> of the ſoul, the will of man, by the uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Compaſs of the will of God. Heaven is the Port for which we all profeſs our ſelves bound, and can it ever be obtained by naked and inefficatious velleities, by a few faint wiſhings and wouldings? What blind <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> would then miſs of it? What ſloathful man, that hideth his hand in his boſome, and will not ſo much as bring it to his mouth again, might not then poſſeſs it, as well as any <hi>Caleb,</hi> or <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> that wholly followed the Lord, or as <hi>David</hi> who fulfilled all his wills? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks that ſaying of our Saviour ſhould be as a Goad in the ſide of every ſluggard, <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doth the will of my father which is in heaven.</hi> However, O holy God, let it quicken me to all diligence in an entire conformity of my will to thy will, that ſo I may readily do what thou commandeſt, and let me eſteem it as the beſt part of heavens happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64536:43"/> that I ſhall one day do it perfectly, as the Angels which behold thy face.</p>

               <p>SOme faces are by the Painter drawn with leſs diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty than others, the lineaments and features of them being ſuch, as are more eaſie for his eye to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and for his hand alſo happily to expreſs. And ſo it is with ſome Subjects of meditation above others, which with leſs labour of the mind are by the Pencill of the thoughts formed into lively reſemblances of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and thereby bearing a proportion to our Senſes, do convey ſpiritual myſteries in a facile and delightful manner to our underſtanding. Such a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is this <hi>Balſam Tree,</hi> which while I think of the <hi>place</hi> of its growth, the way of obtaining its <hi>Juyce,</hi> and the <hi>ſoveraign vertue</hi> that it hath to effect ſtrange cures, and to heal Inveterate diſeaſes, it carries forthwith my thoughts to my bleſſed Saviour, who is the only repoſitory in which God hath laid up all his invaluable treaſures of healing Balſams. It readily ſuggeſts to me ſuch moving Conſiderations as ſerve to exalt Chriſts Excellency in my heart, and to endeare him to me in all the ties of choyceſt affections; And that it may do ſo to others, I will draw the parallel between this Tree and Chriſt, that others may ſee what a ſweet repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it is of him, who, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, forgiveth all our iniquities, who healeth all our diſeaſes. Firſt, the ſole place of this trees growth is in <hi>Emanuels Land.</hi>

Doth it not as a ſpiritual <hi>Hierogliphick,</hi> aſſert that weighty Doctrine of <hi>Peters, That there is no name under heaven given amongſt men, whereby we muſt be ſaved, but by the name of Chriſt?</hi> Why then do men lay out their money for that which is not <hi>Balm,</hi> Why do they take hold ſometimes on one Creature, and ſometimes one another, ſaying, <hi>Be thou our healer, let this ruin be under thy hand?</hi> Is it not one of thoſe glorious Appellations which God in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is pleaſed to take unto himſelf, <hi>Ego Jehovah cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator tuus;</hi> I am the Lord that healeth thee? Take heed then, O Chriſtian, when thou art under any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, or under any malady to cheat thy ſelf with falſe remedies, to uſe <hi>Fig leaves</hi> inſtead of <hi>Figs themſelves. Adam</hi> took the one, which did only hide his nakedneſs, but not cure it; but to reſtore <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> God took the other. Uſe what God hath appointed, not what thou fancieſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This <hi>Balſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>me tree</hi> drops and weeps forth its Balm to heal their wounds, that cut and mangle it, and did not our bleſſed Saviour do thus? What a ſtrange requital did this <hi>great innocent</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> perſon make unto thoſe from whom he ſuffered? They mock and revile him hanging upon the Croſs, and he prayes,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64536:44"/> and begs forgiveneſs for them. They ſhed his bloud, and he makes it a precious Medicine to heal their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred ſores. They ſmite and pierce him to the heart with a Spear, and he erects in his heart a fountain to waſh them from their ſin and uncleanneſs. Was it ever heard, that a Phyſician would ſweat and bleed for his ſurfeited Patient? Or that an offended Prince would expiate the foul Treaſons of his Subjects with his own life? Surely well might the Apoſtle ſay, that <hi>God commended his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us.</hi> Be aſtoniſhed, O ye Angels of Heaven, who delight to pry into Goſpel myſteries at this Abyſs of divine love, from which <hi>Seraphims</hi> themſelves cannot but detract if they ſhould in the leaſt conceive, that they could either fathom with their knowledge, or expreſs in their praiſes. And be ye melted, O rocky hearts of ſinners, with the arden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and ſtrength of ſuch love, which is ſtronger than death it ſelf. It was his love which held him upon the Croſs to finiſh your ſalvation when death could not hold him in the grave. Let this love of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain you henceforth not to live unto your ſelves, but unto him that died for you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This <hi>Balm</hi> which diſtills from this wounded tree is of ſuch vertue and efficacy, as that it is <hi>Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na omni morbia;</hi> Phyſick to cure all diſeaſes, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied inwardly or outwardly. It allayeth the <hi>Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach,</hi> it reſtoreth thy eye-ſight, helpeth the <hi>Aſtmah,</hi> purgeth <hi>Ulcers,</hi> cureth the poyſonful <hi>Sting</hi> of Serpents, healeth all kind of wounds. Is not then this <hi>Balm</hi> in the <hi>Letter</hi> an apt Emblem of the Balm in the <hi>myſtery</hi> of the bloud of Chriſt? Which is of an unlimited power and excellency. What is the evil that can befall any, for which this is not a certain Cure? Oh when taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64536:44"/> as in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, it is both <hi>Food</hi> and <hi>Phyſick,</hi> it enlightens the dark mind, it heals the broken in heart, it fills the hungry with good things. When ſprinkled outwardly, as in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, it is effectual to ſtop the Leproſie of Sin, to cure the venome and rage of Luſts, to mollifie the ſtony heart, and to make fruitful the Barren? Be then of good chear, O ye drooping and afflicted ſouls, let me ſay to you, as <hi>Paul</hi> to thoſe in the tempeſt, <hi>The lives of none of you ſhall be loſt.</hi> If you complain, No ſins like yours; let me adde, There is no Salvation like Chriſts. If you ſay, you are a <hi>Syſteme,</hi> a fardle of ſins and luſts, hear what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The blo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Be not in love with your ſins, as Beggars are with their ſores, that will not part with them, and then doubt not of your Phyſicians <hi>skill,</hi> or <hi>care.</hi> It is his peculiar glory, that never any Patient miſcarried under his hand, though ſuch was their condition, that they were all utterly incurable by any other.</p>

O methinks I cannot without wonder read how <hi>Paul</hi> lived among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in fear and much trembling, as ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the weight of his Miniſtry, and how they again received <hi>Titus, Pauls</hi> Meſſenger, with the like affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not entertaining him with coſtly banquets, with Court-like Salutations, but with fear and trembling, which is the higheſt reſpect that can be ſhowen to the Doctrine of Chriſt. Yea, the Supper of the Lord it ſelf, though it be a Feaſt of Love, in which Chriſt <hi>qui est totus amor eſt caput coenae,</hi> who is all love, is the chief and onely diſh, that a Soul hath to feed upon, is beſt Celebrated with a Divine trembling, which may correct our joy, and keep it from degenerating into a carnal mirth.

Or hint ought that may be uſeful to any man, which grows only from ſo ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a principle as his own ſhadow? And yet if it be true which <hi>Lorinus</hi> ſaith, that the Art of Imagery was <hi>ex umbris nata,</hi> firſt learned from a due obſervation of thoſe reſemblances, and proportions, which the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow bears unto the body; why may not ſome moral Conſiderations be ſuggeſted unto us from the different motions, oppoſite variations, ſudden vaniſhings, which every man may dayly behold in his own ſhadow? Are not theſe genuine thoughts for a man to conceive, that it is with him, and with every Chriſtian, as it is with thoſe who walk with their faces towards the Sun, the dark ſhadow is quite behind them, but when they turn from the Sun, it forthwith changeth its place and comes before them. When they travel with their faces to the Sun of Righteouſneſs, their paths are full of light and comfort; but when they turn from him, what dark Images of death? What gaſtly apparitions of hell and deſtruction do go before them every ſtep they tread?

Surely, they will find, that the ſhades of ſin are far more diſmal than the darkeſt nights of affliction; and that unleſs the light of Gods favour, which like the Sun on the Dyal of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> hath gone down many degrees, do return back again as many, they cannot, like <hi>Ezekiah,</hi> have any comfortable aſſurance that they ſhall live and not dye.

It is a change onely that makes them to be grateful, it being ſometimes as pleaſing to want them as to have them; to lay them aſide, as to put them on.

But the reſolute Marriners in their Ships they both expect and prepare to wraſtle with ſuch difficulties, they ply their Sailes, they fathom the Sea with their Line, they have their hand to the Helm, and their eye to Heaven, they let fall their Anchors, and ride amidſt the Tempeſt till it hath ſpent its fury, with an undaunted Courage.

And therefore he is reſolved with fortitude to withſtand the Corruptions of the Times, to out-face the ſins and ſcornes of Men, to be valiant for a Truth trampled upon, and not to be aſhamed of a Perſecuted Profeſſion, and to bear up againſt the threats and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the moſt Potent Enemies with an unbended conſtancy.

               <p>
                  <hi>SEneca</hi> hath this ſaying, <hi>Precogitati mali mollis ictus,</hi> that the ſtroke of a fore-thought evil is more gentle and ſoft than if it were wholly unexpected; which ſuits well with Saint <hi>Peters</hi> counſel to the ſcattered Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, not to think of the fiery trial, as if ſome ſtrange and new thing had hapned unto them. A Wiſe <hi>Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi> therefore muſt do as a wiſe <hi>builder,</hi> ſit down firſt and count his coſt, left afterwards he expoſe himſelf to ſhame and ſcorn. He muſt firſt view a Priſon in his mind before heenter into it with his body, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weigh what it is he muſt forgo, and what he muſt undergo, or elſe he will ſoon, like <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> couch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his burden, and faint in the day of adverſity, his ſtrength being ſmall. For the change which a Priſon makes is the greateſt that can befall any, next to the Grave, and is but a little ſhort of it, if not equal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. Who can ſet down the ſeveral ſad evils which attend it in diſtinct particulars? And who can ſum them up into a total, that will not amount unto a death? Is not <hi>Liberty,</hi> which every being naturally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64536:51"/> turned into <hi>Bondage?</hi> Is not the <hi>Society</hi> of friends, which is the ſauce, if not the food, of life, changed into <hi>Solitude?</hi> Is not <hi>Light,</hi> whoſe approaches were anciently ſaluted with <hi>welcome light,</hi> induſtriouſly ſhut out, to make both Bonds and Solitude the more irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome? Is not every <hi>Senſe</hi> offended with objects that are diſpleaſing unto them? What doth the <hi>Eye</hi> behold but the face of a grim Jayler? What doth the <hi>Touch</hi> feel unleſs it be hard Fetters and cold walls? What is the <hi>Smell</hi> affected with, unleſs it be a loathſome ſtench? What doth the <hi>Ear</hi> hear, but the ratling of Chains, or the groans of ſome who are breathing out their laſt? And what is the food that is taſted, unleſs it be the bread of adverſity, and the water of aſfliction? And is it not then wonderful, that ſuch a condition as this, which is as the very valley and ſhadow of death, ſhould ever be paſſed thorough without any diſtracting fears, without heart breaking ſorrows, yea, with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings in ſuch tribulations? It is true, that ſome there be who, like <hi>ſullen Hawks,</hi> live upon the <hi>frets,</hi> and bear many of theſe things out of the ſtoutneſs of their ſtomack and their natural courage. But alas! this is not to ſuffer as a Chriſtian, who doth not ſuffer out of <hi>obſtinacy,</hi> but out of <hi>Conſcience;</hi> who is not ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his own inherent <hi>ſtrength,</hi> but by the <hi>power</hi> of God, which puts forth its ſelf in ſuch glorious effects oft times, as that it makes a greater change in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the better, than ever the vileſt Priſon can make in the Priſoner for the worſe. Is it not the preſence of the King that makes the Court, let the Houſe be never ſo mean where he reſides? What then can that place be leſs than a <hi>Pallace</hi> where the Preſence of God dwells in a ſpecial manner? He that ſhall read in the Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> of a City or place that had no
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64536:52"/> 
                  <hi>Temple</hi> in it, nor had no <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Moon</hi> to ſhine in it, and then break off, would ſooner conjecture that he was beginning the deſcription of ſome forlorn place under the Northern Pole, than of the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> But when he ſhall underſtand that <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Lamb</hi> are the <hi>Temple</hi> of it, and the glory of God and the Lamb are the Eternal Light ſhining in it, he will then ſay, as an awaked <hi>Jacob, Surely this is none other but the houſe of God, and the place where himſelf dwelleth.</hi> Such like thoughts muſt that man have of a Priſon who knows no more of it, than what it is in appearance, a place of bondage, ſolitude, darkneſs, and ſore wants; but he who hath in this condition once experienced the preſence of God in it, how differently will he ſpeak of it? Have not many of the Saints, when ſhut up in a Dungeon, dated their Letters to their Friends from their <hi>Pallace,</hi> from their <hi>delectable Orchard,</hi> from their <hi>delicious Paradiſe?</hi> Have they not gloried in their bonds, as being Gods Freemen, though mans Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? Have they not in their ſolitude been raviſhed with the ſweetneſs of that Communion they have had with God, who alone hath been better than a thouſand Friends? Have they not been filled with <hi>hidden Manna</hi> in their ſouls, when their bodies have been pinched with the ſharpneſs of Famine? Have they not in the midſt of their Conflicts cried out, <hi>If it be thus ſweet to ſuffer for Chriſt, how full of Joy unſpeakable will it be to reign with him?</hi> May I not then ſay to this timorous Chriſtian, as God did once to <hi>Iſrael, Fear not to go down into</hi> Egypt, <hi>For I will go down with thee into</hi> Egypt, <hi>and I will ſurely bring thee up again.</hi> Fear not to go into a Priſon, in which God will be with you, and out of which he will deliver you with joy and triumph. It matters not what your preſſures be if God put under
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64536:52"/> his Everlaſting Arms, or who your Enemies be if he be your Friend; or what your ſorrows be, if he be your Comforter. And this I may adde, that commonly in the greateſt ſtraits, he ſheweth the greateſt love, as waters run ſtrongeſt in the narroweſt paſſages. <hi>As the ſufferings of Chriſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) abound in us, ſo our Conſolation aboundeth by Chriſt.</hi> O therefore ſay as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Though I walk through the valley of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death I will fear none evil; for thou art with me, thy rod and thy ſtaff they comfort me.</hi>

               <head>Meditation XXXVI. Vpon the motion of the Sun on the Dyall.</head>
               <p>IT was the ſaying of one, who was none of the leaſt of the Philoſophers, to him that asked him what he was born for? That it was to contemplate the Sun: But though it be not the <hi>end</hi> of mans <hi>breath,</hi> yet it may well be the <hi>object</hi> of his <hi>thoughts,</hi> in regard both of its <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>motion.</hi> Holy <hi>David</hi> takes notice of them both in the ſame Pſalm, in which he compared the Sun for its <hi>Luſtre</hi> to a <hi>Bridegroom</hi> coming out of his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber cloathed in ſuch ſhining Array, as may draw the eyes of Spectators towards him: And for its <hi>ſwiftneſs</hi> to a ſtrong <hi>Champion,</hi> who runs his preſcribed courſe, both ſpeedily and unweariedly. <hi>Tully,</hi> in his <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall Queſtions,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Tanta incitatione fertur ut ejus celeritas quanta ſit ne cogitari quidem poſſet.</hi> It is whir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led about with that vehemency that the greatneſs of the Suns ſpeed cannot eaſily be imagined. Is it not then a Riddle, that at the ſame time when it travels thouſands
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64536:53"/> of miles in the <hi>Heavens</hi> it ſhould make ſo ſlow a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and progreſs on the <hi>Dyall,</hi> as not to move above the breadth of an inch or two? To the quickeſt eye its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is imperceptible, and it ſo moves, as we can only ſay it hath moved, not that it doth. Now from whence comes this inequality, but from the vaſt diſproportion between the Heavens and the Earth, the one being but as a Center or ſmall prick to an immenſe Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. O how happy and regular alſo would the lives and actions of men be if after the ſame manner they were moved to <hi>heavenly</hi> and <hi>earthly</hi> objects? To the one with a ſwiftneſs like to that of the Sun in the <hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament:</hi> To the other with an inſenſibleneſs, like to that of the Sun upon the <hi>Dyall.</hi> Surely ſuch a diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion doth the differing worth and excellency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the one and the other juſtly challenge in our purſuit of them. Is it not meet that he who caſts a ſingle glance of his eye to the Creature, ſhould beſtow a thouſand looks on his Saviour? And when he creeps to one as a <hi>Snail,</hi> to fly to the other as the <hi>Eagle</hi> to the Carkaſs? He alone moves to God as much as he ought, who moves to him as much as he can, and ſtrives to repair the imperfection of that motion, with a real diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and regret of the ſlowneſs of his own heart to the beſt of goods. But alaſs, if the rule by which men walk muſt be thus bounded, or dilated according to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to which they move, where ſhall we find that perſon that thus proportions the out-goings of his ſoul in his care, deſires, or induſtry? If the ſtandard and meaſure of goodneſs ſhould be taken, from the unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riedneſs of mens travels, from the ſtrength of their affections, or from the fixed bent of their reſolutions to obtain what they deſign to themſelves as their end: Who muſt not then put the Crown of bleſſedneſs upon
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64536:53"/> the he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d of the Creature which ought to be ſet at the foot of the Creator? Who muſt not then conclude, that it is better building Tabernacles here, than ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Country which is above? Do not men contract their hearts to the things of Heaven, and dilate them to what is below? Do they not run and pant, to the very breathing out of their ſouls, after periſhing vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, when they cannot be drawn to ſet one foot to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſpiritual and divine Excellencies? Do they not take the Wings of the Morning, and fly to the utmoſt end of the Earth in their muſings and thoughts to find out riches that will not profit in the day of wrath? when their Eſſaies to Heaven are as weak as the Graſhoppers, who give only a ſmall ſlirt upwards and then falls down to the Earth again. O that I could with plenty of tears bemoan that monſtrous <hi>Ataxie</hi> and perverſeneſs which ſin hath wrought in the moſt noble parts of man. Was not that agility of mind given unto him by God, that he might have his Converſation in Heaven, though his abode was on Earth? And that he might enter into the <hi>holy</hi> of <hi>holies,</hi> not like the High Prieſt, once in a year, but in every prayer and duty, like a winged Angel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the face of God, and look into thoſe things that are within the Veil? But now alas! he can only, like that lapſed Angel, compaſs the earth to and fro in his thoughts, and deſcend as low as hell in his luſts, but cannot raiſe himſelf above the world to the performance of the leaſt good. I feel, O my God, continually the ſad change which ſin hath made in me, not ſo much deſtroying my Faculties, as perverting them; I have not loſt the uſe of them, but the rectitude of them. I am no more weary of ſinning, than a ſwift ſtream of running; the ſame weight of ſin that hinders me from running the race which is ſet before me, hurries me to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64536:54"/> evil, and makes me, through the impulſions of Satan, to gather ſtrength by an acceſſory impreſſion. In the births of ſin I am, like the <hi>Hebrew</hi> women, lively and quick of delivery; but in the bringing forth of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is good, like a ſlow <hi>Egyptian</hi> that needs the aide of a Midwife. l therefore beg of thee holy Lord to heal my diſtempers by thy grace, and to renew me in the ſpirit of my mind that I may run the way of thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments when thou haſt enlarged my heart.</p>

               <head>Meditation XXXVII. Vpon a Sun-Dyal and a Clock.</head>
               <p>THeſe two Artificial meaſures of time give one and the ſame account of its motions, but in a very differing, if not contrary, manner. The <hi>Clock</hi> doth it by a motion of its own; but the <hi>Sun-Dyall,</hi> while it ſelf is fixed, by an extrinſick motion of the Sun upon thoſe Lines drawn upon it <hi>effects</hi> the ſame thing. And this occaſioned me to think in what a differing way the ſame ſervices and duties of Religion are done by thoſe that profeſs it. Some, like <hi>Clocks,</hi> have a Spring of motions in themſelves, and the weight that quickens and actuates it is love: They pray, confer, exerciſe holineſs in their Converſation in a progreſſive manner, Salvation being nearer to them than when they firſt believed. Others again are like <hi>Sun-Dyals,</hi> that are as uſeleſs poſts in a gloomy day, and are deſtitute of all principles of motion. The Sun moveth upon them, but they ſtand ſtill. The Spirit comes upon them, as it did on <hi>Saul,</hi> but themſelves are not in the leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64536:54"/> by thoſe duties that others may think they profit by. There is a light and ſhine which paſſeth upon their gifts and abilities that may render them uſeful as well as viſible unto others, but it effecteth no alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their hearts to the bettering of themſelves. What divine Viſions and Propheſies did <hi>Balaam</hi> both ſee and utter concerning <hi>Iſrael?</hi> And how remarkable is the Preface which he ſets before them? <hi>The man whoſe eyes are open hath ſaid,</hi> yet his heart is fixed to his luſt of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, and he is ſo far from taking the leaſt ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their <hi>Tents,</hi> which with admiration he beholds to be goodly, as that he gives <hi>Balack</hi> counſel how to deſtroy them. Let not then any reſt in a bare illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or tranſient work of the Spirit upon them, as if that ſuch things would be ſufficient evidences of the goodneſs of their con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ition. Light may make a good head, but it is heat and motion that muſt make a good heart, without which all profeſſion of Religion is but an unſavoury Carkaſs. Be wiſe therefore O Chriſtians, and build not the foundation of your eternal happineſs upon ſuch uncertain principles. May not the Spirit <hi>aſſiſt</hi> where it never <hi>inhabits?</hi> May it not <hi>move</hi> upon him, whom it never <hi>quickens?</hi> Were not many <hi>workers of iniquity,</hi> who were <hi>workers of miracles?</hi> Were not many famous for their <hi>Propheſies,</hi> who were infamous for their <hi>Profaneneſs?</hi> Are not ſuch things made by Chriſt, the plea of many in the laſt day for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into heaven, whom he will not know? Why then ſhould any be ſo fooliſh to make that a Plea to the Judge which he knows beforehand will be rejected? The beſt way to diſcern our condition, is not to argue the goodneſs of it from the light which the Spirit darts in upon us, but by the motions which it produceth in us. As many as are the Sons of God are led by the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64536:55"/> Spirit of God, in a conſtant way of progreſſion, from grace to grace, from vertue to vertue. Such light, as it is ſudden in its <hi>Eruptions,</hi> ſo it is alſo in its <hi>Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> the one oft times are as ſpeedy and momentary as the other. Look therefore to the <hi>attractions</hi> of the Spirit by which you are moved, &amp; drawn to walk in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waies, rather than to ſuch <hi>motions</hi> of the Spirit, which paſs only upon you, but do not beget any motion or ſtirring in you.</p>

This is the only homage that thoſe Stars of the Morning, and ſons of God, who behold his face, do give in heaven, and this is it which the Children of men ſhould give on Earth. But alas! from how few are thoſe ſacred dues tendred to God, though all be his debtors? Doth not the rich man, when wealth floweth in upon him like a river, forget that the Lord only giveth him power to get riches? And ſacrifice unto his Net, and burn Incenſe unto his Drag?

If any deſign be effected, they think that their wiſdom hath brought it about; if any difficulties be removed, they aſcribe it to their induſtry; if ſucceſs and victory do build upon their Sword, it is their own arm, and right hand that hath obtained it. O how great is that pride and unthankfulneſs which reigns in the hearts of men, who affect to rob God, rather than to

Is not this to croſs the great deſign of the Goſpel, which is to

               <p>EXile is a Change of place that brings no evil with it, but in opinion; a Complaint, and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wholly imaginary, is the deſcription ſome have made of it. But it ſeemes to me to be rather a <hi>Stoicks</hi> vaunt, than a <hi>Chriſtians</hi> juſt eſtimate, of the evils of that condition. What trial elſe would it have been of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, to leave his <hi>Country, Kindred, and Fathers Houſe, and to go to a Land God would ſhew him?</hi> or why did God injoyn <hi>Iſrael</hi> to pitty Strangers; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe themſelves had been Strangers in the Land of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Why have <hi>Legiſlators</hi> deemed it as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for grand Crimes, and next to Capital? or why have many looked upon it as worſe than death, chuſing rather the <hi>lot</hi> of the <hi>Goat</hi> that was to be Sacrificed, then the lot of the <hi>Scape Goat,</hi> which was to be ſent into the Wilderneſs? is it not becauſe (as <hi>Philo</hi> ſaith) death is the full end of all evils? but Baniſhment the beginning of many new ones? Want, Scorn, Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Unjuſt Jealouſies, are the daily hard Meaſures that Exiles muſt expect to meet with; he muſt thank him who demands his Coat, that he asketh not his
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64536:58"/> Life; and he muſt oft times redeem his Life, with that little Money which he hath, that ſhould buy him Bread to preſerve it. He muſt be armed with nothing but patience, leaſt he be apprehended as one that hath in deſign the death of ſome other. And yet how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Arguments of comfort can my thoughts ſuggeſt to ſuch Chriſtians, who for the Truths ſake either dread this Croſs, or feel it. They break forth ſo on the right hand, and on the left, as that methinks I may ſay, Sing O ye Baniſhed, cry aloud, for more are the comforts of the deſolate, than the comforts of thoſe that ſit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow of their own roof.

But how is this done? is it by <hi>Reading</hi> onely the Scriptures, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving the Senſe, though that be a Publick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, and highly to be honoured of all, or by a diligent and well digeſted <hi>Preaching</hi> of them, in which the Truths delivered are ſucked in as Milk from the Breaſt that partakes of the warmth and ſpirits of the Nurſe?

They ſin againſt the Soules of others, and you ſin againſt your own Soules: And yet how great are the numbers upon whom the guilt of this Crime may be Charged? Some think that they are paſt their Childhood, and therefore <hi>Wean</hi> themſelves; they know as much as their <hi>Teachers</hi> can tell them, and to what end then ſhould they ſtill give them their Attendance; to hanker after the Breaſt is for Babes, not for grown Perſons? But are not they who thus ſpeak puffed up, and know nothing as they ought? Is not this whole life a ſtate of Infancy in reſpect of perſection? doth not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſay, that <hi>we ſee but darkly, and know but in part.</hi> Why then ſhould the old <hi>Mnaſons</hi> be more aſhamed of theſe Breaſts, then the young <hi>Timothies?

Are they not in thus doing <hi>fures de ſe,</hi> thieves to their own Soules, depriving themſelves of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of both, while they are willfull neglecters of each. Be wiſe therefore, O Chriſtians, in keeping up an high eſteem of the Word Preached, and be alwayes as Babes for hunger and deſire after it; though not for knowledg and underſtanding in it. And remember that there is no way ſo dangerous to leſſen your deſires, as to keep your ſelves faſting from it. For the Word of God ſtill creates new appetites, as it ſatisfies the old; and enlargeth the capacities of the Soul, as it fills it. Uſe good Books as Apothecaries do their <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedanea,</hi> one ſimple to ſupply the want of another; when the Preacher cannot be had then make uſe of them; but let it rather be to ſtay the ſtomach in the abſence of an Ordinance, then to ſatisfie it. And when you enjoy both, ſay as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſometimes did of the <hi>Rhodian</hi> and <hi>Lesbian</hi> Wine, when he had taſted of both; that the <hi>Rhodian</hi> was good too, but the <hi>Lesbian</hi> was the pleaſanter. Holy Books are good, and reliſh well, but the Word Preached is more ſweet; the one is as the Wine the Bridegroom provided at the Marriage Feaſt, and the other as that which Chriſt made, which was eaſily diſcerned by the Governour, who knew not whence it was, to be by far the better.</p>

For have we not two Natures in us, the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Fleſh,</hi> the <hi>New,</hi> and <hi>Old Man?</hi> have we not <hi>twins</hi> in our Womb, our Counter-luſtings, and our Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willings?

The Phyſician is not leſs loyal to his Prince if he give to him an unpleaſing <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,</hi> and to a poor Man a cheering <hi>Cordiall,</hi> becauſe his
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64536:62"/> Applications are not according to the dignity of the Perſon, but to the quality of the Diſeaſe: neither is God the leſs kind when he puts into our hand the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Cup</hi> of aſfliction to drink of, then when he makes us to caſte of the <hi>Flaggons</hi> of his ſweeteſt wine. <hi>Paul</hi> his <hi>Thorn in the Fleſh,</hi> what ever the meaning of it be, was uſefull to keep down that tumor of pride, which the abundance of Revelations might have expoſed him unto; and ſo joyned together they were like the <hi>rod</hi> and the <hi>Honey</hi> which enlightned <hi>Jonathans</hi> eyes: when he had taſted the ſweetneſs of the one, God would have him feel the ſmart of the other.

Hereby we are put upon the exerciſe of all thoſe Graces which are accommodated to our imperfect ſtate here below, whoſe acts ſhall not be compleated in Heaven, but ſhall all ceaſe, as being not capacitated for a Fruition: and yet are of great uſe while we are on this ſide Heaven. How neceſſary is <hi>Patience</hi> to bear up the Soul under trials that it fret not againſt God who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts them? How greatly doth <hi>Hope</hi> temper any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſouer by its expectation of ſome happy change that may and will follow, and ſo worketh joy in the midſt of ſadneſs? How even to wonder doth Faith manifeſt its power in all diſtreſſes, when it apprehends that there are no degrees of extremity unrelieveable by the Arm of God, or inconſiſtent with his compaſſions and friendſhip? Again, ſuch Mixtures ſerve to work in us a greater hatred of ſin, and an earneſt longing after Glory; in which, our life, light, joyes, are all pure, and everlaſting. Our life is without any ſeed of death, our light without any ſhadow of darkneſs, and our joyes endleſs <hi>Hallelujahs,</hi> without the interruption of one ſigh. Therefore are we burdened in our Earthly Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, that we ſhould the more groan to be clothed upon with our houſe which is from Heaven.

When not to ſin, which is here onely our <hi>Duty,</hi> ſhall be the top branch of our reward and bleſſedneſs.

               <p>HOw often and how exactly do <hi>Phyſicians</hi> feel the <hi>Pulſe</hi> of their Patients? Not a day paſſeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſtrict obſervation of the motions that it makes, according unto which they judge both of the greatneſs and danger of the diſtemper, and what the Iſſues are like to be both in reſpect of life and death. They do not as other Viſitors, ask the Patient how he doth, but inform him rather how he is, and from the report which they make of his malady, his fears and hopes are the more or leſs. And yet how rarely do they feel their own pulſe, who are ſo ſeemingly anxious about ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Daies, Weeks, Months do Elapſe, and paſs away without any ſuch ſtudious heeding of themſelves, as they continually in their profeſſion Exerciſe towards others. And yet happily in ſo doing they are as the Prieſts in the Temple, who (as our Saviour ſaith) prophane the Sabbath and are blameleſs. But they occaſion me to think of the practiſe of many, who cannot ſo eaſily be acquitted; Such who are ſevere ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64536:66"/> of other mens waies and actions, and as great neglectors of their own; who are far more glad that they can eſpy a fault in others, than grieved that it is committed: who preſume to look into the breaſt, and to diſcover how the Affections, which are the pulſe of the ſoul, do bear and work in every duty. In ſome they miſlike the heat of their Zeal, as too much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling an high and vehement pulſe, whoſe ſtrength and quickneſs comes not from <hi>health,</hi> but from a <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> In others they condemn lukewarmneſs, an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency, whoſe affections they judge to be as a weak and ſlow pulſe, or as the Spring of a Watch that is well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh down, which <hi>Clicks</hi> and moves very faintly. In ſome again they obſerve an inequality in their Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is accompanied with frequent ſtands and pauſes that they make; like <hi>Aſthmatical</hi> and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breathed perſons, they run a while and blow longer, before they can move again. And upon theſe they look with as ſad a countenance as a Phyſician doth upon his Patient that hath a falſe and intermitting pulſe. Few or none can be found to eſcape their cenſure, who obſerve the failings of others, as ſome ancient <hi>Criticks</hi> did the imperfect Verſes of <hi>Homer,</hi> which they learned by heart, not at all regarding the many good. But what can be more contrary to the Law and rule of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity than ſuch practiſes? How many <hi>Prohibitions</hi> are gone out of the Court of Heaven to ſtay ſuch irregular proceedings? Are we not by Chriſt forbid to <hi>judge that we be not judged?</hi> To judge nothing before the time untill the Lord come? And yet what if any man could know the true temper of the affections of others, as fully as a Phyſician c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Surely this man, as the <hi>hungry,</hi> would be filled with good things, when the other, as the <hi>rich,</hi> ſhould be ſent empty away. He, as the humble <hi>Publican,</hi> would be juſtified, when the other, as the proud <hi>Phariſee,</hi> ſhould be condemned. Let others then, Phyſician like, ſtudy the condition of others, I ſhall look upon it as my duty, and make it my work, not to find out what others are, but what I am in regard of my unfained love and affection unto Chriſt, who hath tranſcendently merited my love, though I am wholly unworthy of his. <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> is famed in Hiſtory for diſcovering the love of <hi>Antiochus</hi> to his Mother-in-law which ſhame forced him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal, by the motion of his pulſe, which he obſerved to move differently in her preſence from what it did at other times. O how happy ſhould I deem my ſelf if I could find the pulſe of my affections alwaies working more quick and lively in me whenever I behold my Saviour preſent in the feaſt of love, in which he is pleaſed not only to let me ſee him, but to enjoy him; or when I hear his name mentioned in a duty, or when I read his name written in his Word, which is therefore the ſweeter becauſe his name is ſo often in it; but I have cauſe to be aſhamed at the uneven temper of my heart, which diſcovers it ſelf in thoſe intermiſſions of love and affection that I too often labour under; how often am I chill and cold in the ſame duty? At what poor trifles do I often ſtick, when my love to him ſhould bluſh at the name of difficulty? Can I ever do, or ſuffer for him too much, whoſe perfections render him wholly uncapable of being loved too much? If I were

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64536:68"/> who, as if they had forgotten what <hi>Amaleck</hi> had done are ſetting on ſoot overtures of Peace, and termes of Accommodation between <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> and <hi>Popery?</hi> as if the diſtances between the one and the other were more ſeeming than reall, and might as readily be brought together as the two extreames of a Serpent, who can, when he pleaſeth, caſt himſelf into a Circle, and take his Tail into his Mouth? But who knoweth not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump; and ſo will a little Error diffuſe its poyſon through the whole body of truth, like a drop of oyl on Cloath, it no ſooner falls then ſpreads; like a ſpark on Tinder it catcheth, and runs at once. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> would not for one hour give place unto falſe Brethren, leaſt the Truth of the Goſpel might be endangered. To do it then with the leaſt prejudice to Truth is ſinfull; and to effect it without it is impoſſible. Sooner may they reconcile <hi>Antipathies</hi> in Nature, than in Religion: When therefore they have combined Fire and Water, without extinction of each other, and made an amity between the <hi>Dove</hi> and the <hi>Hawk,</hi> between the <hi>Waſpe</hi> and the <hi>Bee;</hi> So that the one ſhall not infeſt the other, then may they promiſe themſelves ſucceſs, in making up the breaches between <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Zion.</hi> But O that they who are ſo ſludious to make ſtrife to ceaſe between the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> would bend their Mindes to heal the Diviſions of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> among whom there are great thoughts and ſearchings of heart. Is it not pity to ſee the Induſtrious Bees, whoſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are ſo uſefull to their owner, to make a War in the Mouth of their Hive, and to kill one another by thoſe Stings with which they ſhould defend their Cells againſt Waſpes and Drones? and is it not then a ſad ſpectacle to behold Chriſtians who ſhould be
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64536:69"/> joyned together, <hi>fidei vinculo, glutine Charitatis;</hi> by the Bond and Cement of Faith and Love, to be divided one from another, and in Animoſities to draw the Sword, and to ſheath it alſo in the Bowells of each other? And yet ſuch heats there have ſometimes been, and ſtill are between Brethren. I could me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks give way to my Sorrow, and let it overflow the Bankes, to ſee Profeſſors to be leſs tender of Chriſts Body, than the Souldiers were of his Coat; and few or none to prize that Unity which is the Glory of the Faith of the Goſpel. Have we not all one Father, God bleſſed for ever? have we not all one Elder Brother, Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Firſt-Borne of every Creature? are we not all quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by one Spirit, who is a Spirit of Love? are we not all under one Solemne Vow of Baptiſme, in which we have dedicated our ſelves to Gods Service as his Souldiers? how can we then turn Enemies one to another?

               <p>IT is our Saviours Maxim, that <hi>Mans life conſiſteth not in the abundance of things which he poſſeſſeth.</hi> If there be any happineſs upon Earth, it is in that we call <hi>Contentation,</hi> which cometh from the <hi>Minde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> and not from <hi>the things without.</hi> Perfect <hi>Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> is to be had onely in Heaven, where we ſhall be happy, not by the <hi>Confinement,</hi> but by the <hi>Fruition</hi> of our deſires: Then (ſaith <hi>David)</hi> I <hi>ſhall be ſatisfied, when I awake with thy likeneſs.</hi> How happy therefore is every Godly Mans Condition, who are the onely Perſons that are inſtructed in the Myſtery of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment while they live on Earth, and ſhall be in Heaven the ſole Poſſeſſors of perfect and everlaſting Bleſſedneſs? True it is, that <hi>Philoſophy</hi> hath great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prized, and earneſtly ſought this Rich Jewell of Contentation; but <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> hath onely found it. The <hi>Moraliſts</hi> have exerciſed their Wits in giving of Rules to attain it, and have let fall ſome Sentences that may deſerve to be put in the Chriſtians <hi>Regiſter,</hi> but they could never look into the true Grounds from whence ſound Contentment doth ariſe, and upon which it is to be built. The higheſt of their <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> have not (as I may ſay) the root of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in them, and are therefore inſufficient wholly to compoſe the Minde, to ſuch a Calme and Even Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as may, in the variety of Changes, ſhew and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover its ſelf to be ſo reconciled to its preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64536:70"/> as not to loſe its Inward Peace and Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, whatſoever the Stormes and Croſs Accidents are from without. What are the Conſiderations which they preſcribe as a ſupport againſt Poverty, Sickneſs, Impriſonment, loſs of Friends, Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſuch like Evils? are they not Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons drawn from the Dignity of <hi>Man,</hi> from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and uncertainty of all <hi>outward things;</hi> from the ſhortneſs and frailty of <hi>Life,</hi> from the befalling of the ſame things unto others? But alaſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> what ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Props are theſe to bear the ſtreſs and weight of thoſe Armies of Trialls, which at once may affault the Life of Man. Theſe may haply ſerve as ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary helpes to alleviate the bitterneſs of ſome Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, when we are apt to think them greater than what others have felt, or longer than what others have endured: But to keep the Minde in Peace in the midſt of all aeſtuations from without, there muſt be more Effectual Remedies than either <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Morality</hi> can ſuggeſt. From whence then can true Contentment ariſe but from <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> which hath a <hi>Sufficiency</hi> to eſtabliſh the Heart? it is that alone which bringeth a Man home to God, out of whom neither Contentment, nor Satisfaction can ever be had. It is that which acquainteth a Man with that great Secret, of Gods <hi>Speciall Providence</hi> over his Children, who Rules the World, not onely as a Lord, to make them ſenſible of his <hi>Power,</hi> but as a loving Father to make them confident of his <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> whereby he diſpoſeth all things for the beſt. O when Faith hath once apprehended this, how firmly can it reſt upon the Promiſes which are made to Godlineſs, both of this life and that which is to come? How can it work far more Contentation with
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64536:70"/> the meaneſt <hi>Food,</hi> than others have with the coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt <hi>Delicates;</hi> with the pooreſt <hi>Raiment,</hi> than others have with their richeſt <hi>Ornaments?</hi> It is Faith onely that teacheth a Chriſtian like a skilfull <hi>Muſician,</hi> to let down a String a Peg lower, when the Tune requires it; or like an experienced <hi>Spagirick</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, or intend his Furnace as occaſion ſerves. Such an one was <hi>Paul,</hi> who learned this heavenly Art, not at <hi>Gamaliels feet,</hi> but in <hi>Chriſts School,</hi> the Holy Spirit of God being his Teacher, ſo that he knew both how to want and how to abound, and in whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver State he was therewith to be content. Let none then ſo far admire thoſe Heathen Sages in thoſe ſpeculations of theirs concerning this Myſtery, as if they had attained to hit that Mark at which they levelled, and had arrived at the utmoſt boundaries of it. Whenas in all their Eſſayes, they have fallen as far ſhort of true Contentation, as Sick Mens <hi>Slumbrings</hi> and Dreams, do of a ſound and healthfull reſt. Of all their <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> I may ſay as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> did of <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> in an Epiſtle of his, <hi>Si legas eum ut paganum, ſcripſit Chriſtianè ſi ut Chriſtianum, ſcripſit paganicè;</hi> If you read them as the Sayings of Heathens, they ſpeak Chriſtianly; but if you look upon them as the Sayings of Chriſtians, they ſpeak Paganly. And how could it be that they ſhould ever do otherwiſe? they being wholly deſtitute of the <hi>Light of Grace,</hi> and the <hi>Guidance of the Spirit,</hi> which are both requiſite to this high and holy Learning? the one as a <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> and the other as a <hi>Teacher.</hi> But yet this I muſt ſay alſo, that they have done enough to ſhame many, who, enjoying the Benefit of <hi>Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> and living in the open Sun-ſhine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, have profited thereby in ſo ſmall a Proportion
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64536:71"/> beyond them. Who can forbear bluſhing to ſee thoſe who Profeſs to be Chriſtians, to live ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law and Rule which they ſhould walk by? to ſeek contentment, not by <hi>moderating their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,</hi> but by <hi>ſatisfying</hi> them, which will ſtill <hi>encreaſe,</hi> as things <hi>come on:</hi> like to Rivers, which the more they are fed, and the further they run, the wider they ſpread. Can it rationally be deemed by any, that thoſe things which are <hi>Summes</hi> in the <hi>deſire,</hi> and <hi>Cyphers</hi> in the <hi>fruition,</hi> ſhould ever effect contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the minde? Is not the deficiency that Men ſee in their abundance the ground of their Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it? and can they ever, by the Additions which they make, heal its deficiency? why then ſhould any try and attempt ſuch fruitleſs projects, which cannot but end in diſappointment? Methinks I ſhould not need to expoſtulate the matter with Chriſtians: That anointing which teacheth them all things, ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in this, that Godlineſs is the onely way to <hi>Contentment</hi> in this life, and <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> in the other. But Lord, however others live, help me to bring my Minde to my Condition, which is as well my duty as my happineſs while I am on earth; and to reſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that in heaven thou wilt bring my Eſtate to my Minde, which is that I may enjoy thee in whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is fulneſs of joy, and at whoſe right hand there are pleaſures for evermore.</p>

               <p>LAwes, ſignally good, oft times derive their birth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common Saying, from evil Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſpringing like fair and beautifull Flowers from a black and deformed Root: And ſo likewiſe the many and ingenuous Explorations of finding out the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between things of worth and their Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits; and of ſeeing into the particular defects of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, have been occaſioned from the multiplicity of deceits, which have riſen either from natural ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, or corrupt Practiſes. The skilfull <hi>Lapidary</hi> hath, by his obſervation, learned to know a falſe <hi>Stone</hi> from a true, which the common Eye cannot diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. The <hi>Herbaliſts</hi> do difference <hi>Plants</hi> ſometimes by the Root, ſometimes by the Taſte, when the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Leaf is perfectly the ſame. The <hi>Cautious</hi> Receiver, that he be not couzened by adulterated <hi>Coyne</hi> for <hi>true,</hi> makes an <hi>Artificial Touchſtone</hi> of his Senſes, he <hi>bends</hi> it, he <hi>rings</hi> it, he <hi>rubs</hi> it, and <hi>ſmells</hi> to it, that thereby he may finde out what it is: The circumſpect <hi>Merchant</hi> contents not himſelf with the ſeeing and feeling of his <hi>Cloth</hi> as it lies made up; but he puts it upon the <hi>Perch,</hi> and ſetting it between the light and himſelf drawes it leaſurely over; and ſo diſcovers not onely the rents and holes that are in it, but the inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the threads, the unevenneſs of its ſpinning, the ſpots and ſtaines that are in it, and what not? that may make it either to be rejected for its defects, or approved
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64536:72"/> for its goodneſs. O how impartial a Judge is light; which neither flatters friends, nor wrongs enemies; which manifeſts the good as well as the evil to what ever it is applyed? This kinde of triall hints to me the beſt manner of doing that work, which every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ought to perform with the greateſt care, the ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and examining of his own wayes. I may learn from what is done to the Cloth, to do the ſame Spiritually to my ſelf, by ſetting my actions between the light of the Word, and the Diſcerning power of Conſcience, that ſo the one may diſcover, and the other may judge what their rectitude or pravity is? and this is beſt done when every parcel of the Converſation is looked into, and ſcanned, as the Cloth that is drawn over the Perch; then it is that I find the unevenneſs of my Duties, the diſtractions of my Thoughts, and the unbelief of my Heart, which runs as a continued Thread from one end of the Duty unto the other. Then it is that I eſpy thoſe ſecret ſtaines of Hypocriſie which diſcolour my ſervices, and blemiſh them to God, when they ſeem fair to the eye of Man; Then it is that convinced of my filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I cry out, My <hi>Perſon</hi> wants a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with infinite <hi>guilt,</hi> that without him cannot be covered. My <hi>nature</hi> wants a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> which is over-run with an univerſal <hi>leproſie,</hi> that without him cannot be cured. My <hi>Sins</hi> want a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> which are for their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as the ſands, and for their greatneſs as the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that without him can never be pardoned. My <hi>holy things</hi> want a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> which are defiled with the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Eruptions of ſin and folly, that without him can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be accepted. And who is it that thus vieweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by this perfect Law of Liberty, that is not thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected? What faith <hi>Paul</hi> of himſelf? <hi>I was alive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut the Law once, but when the Commandment came ſin
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64536:72"/> revived, and I died:</hi> who was once more full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceired abilities to perform the Righteouſneſs of the Law without blame? Who was more preſumptuous in ſelf-Juſtifications, and elated thoughts of his Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> while he was without the Law? that is, not without the <hi>Letter,</hi> but without the <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſenſe</hi> and penetrative power of it; but when the Commandment came in its Vigour and Life, how ſuddenly did all thoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſwaſions of his own Righteouſneſs vaniſh into nothing? He then loſt his confidence of being Saved by his obedience to the Law; and by the light of it diſcovered thoſe inward Luſtings, and deſires to be ſinfull, and ſuch as ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him unto Death, which before were wholly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and unſeen.

What ſwarmes are there of ſins, which Chriſtians complain of, that the Natural Man is totally ignorant of, and can no more diſcover, without the aid of the Word, than the Eye can diſcern its own Blood-ſhed without the help of a Glaſs?

               <head>Meditation XLVIII. Vpon the ſight of a Grave newly made.</head>
               <p>IT is happily no pleaſing ſight, but queſtionleſs very profitable, to look ſometimes into <hi>the houſe appointed for all living,</hi> as holy <hi>Job</hi> calls the <hi>Grave.</hi> Though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than beauty can be ſeen which may delight the <hi>Eye,</hi> yet much may be beheld that may paſſionately affect the <hi>heart.</hi> The thoughts which it ſugeſted to me were like unto the <hi>Cloud</hi> that was between the Camp of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and the Camp of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which had both a dark and bright ſide: The one caſts down, and the other raiſeth up, but both are uſeful. <hi>My dark</hi> and <hi>ſad</hi> thoughts ſprang from the conſideration of the <hi>entry</hi> of death, which came into the world by ſin; it is ſin that hath made all the <hi>Funerals</hi> that ever have been. In our Creation, death had neither <hi>matter</hi> in us, nor <hi>right</hi> over us: Our Innocency was free of any <hi>neceſſity</hi> of death. As God made us living Creatures, ſo his power was able to ſuſtain us <hi>immortal</hi> creatures; we had bodily life by our ſoul in our body, and ſpiritual life by Gods Image in both, but ſin brought on us death of all ſorts: Death <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> in the loſs of Gods Image, death <hi>bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> in the begun corruption of our body, and death <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> in the endleſs ruine of both. And whom would not this ſingle thought afflict with dread and ſorrow to ſee what a change ſin hath made in the condition of man? If <hi>Adam</hi> would have lived without ſin, he might have lived without end: But now by his credulous receiving the Serpents Poyſon, <hi>Death</hi> is glued to our nature,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64536:74"/> neceſſity of evil to the <hi>freedom</hi> of our <hi>will,</hi> and all <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery</hi> to <hi>our ſelves.</hi> Another dark and poſing thought did ariſe from the <hi>progreſs</hi> of death, which keeps no order or method. It thruſts its ſickle not only into the ripe <hi>corn,</hi> but the green <hi>blade;</hi> it nips the <hi>bloſſom,</hi> as well as gathers the <hi>fruit;</hi> it diſſolves the knot that was but new made between the ſoul and the body, as well as that which age and years had con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

There were I obſerved <hi>skulls</hi> of all <hi>Sizes:</hi> There were ſome who had never ſeen the Sun to paſs from one <hi>Tropick</hi> to the other: Others there were whoſe life could not be reckoned by <hi>daies,</hi> or <hi>hours,</hi> but by <hi>minutes;</hi> they dropt only from the <hi>Womb</hi> to the <hi>Grave.</hi> And is not this amongſt the ſecrets of God, that thouſands ſhould thus paſs through the world, and be determined to different Eſtates for Eternity? What can I ſay? But that <hi>the waies of God are unſearchable, and his Judgements paſt finding out.</hi> As it now ſhews his Soveraignty, thus to deal with his Creatures as it pleaſeth him; ſo the Great Day will manifeſt the Wiſdom and Juſtice of God that is wrapt up in theſe myſterious providences. He that is the Judge of all, will be found to be righteous towards all. A third ſad thought, <hi>The conſuming power of the grave</hi> did ſtir up within me, ſo that I was ready to ſay, <hi>Can theſe dry bones live?</hi> Can theſe mingled duſts be diſtinguiſhed? Can the duſts that are ſcattered into diſtances be ever united? Doth not the <hi>Noble</hi> and the <hi>Baſe,</hi> the <hi>Saint,</hi> and the <hi>Sinner</hi> lye equally under the power of corruption? Who then would not dread to deſcend into the Grave, and make <hi>Hemans</hi> queſtion, <hi>Will God ſhew wonders to the dead, ſhall the dead ariſe and praiſe him?</hi> But when I conſider, that Believers in their aſcending into heaven, do only let fall their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the earth, as <hi>Elijah</hi> dropt his Mantle, when he
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64536:74"/> was taken up, and that their Spirits return to God that gave them. That Death ſtriketh not on the <hi>New man,</hi> but on the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> which is a common Lodging both to Fleſh and Spirit, my fears are greatly Alleviated, for who is much ſolicitous for the Cabinet when the Jewel is ſafe. Yea, when I think that death, which ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates our perſons from the world, our ſoul from the body, and every part of our body from another, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſſolve our Union with Chriſt; but that then we ſleep in him, and ſhall be raiſed by him, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to him, as the pattern of our glory. O how do theſe moſt radiant thoughts diſpell both the <hi>black fears</hi> of death, and the <hi>lightſome comforts</hi> of the world, as the riſing Sun makes the bright ſtars of heaven to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, as well as the dark <hi>ſhades</hi> of the night? How little then doth the love of this life, or the difficulties of death abate the deſires of a Believer, <hi>to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt, which is far better?</hi> Who can wonder at old <hi>Simeons</hi> importunity to depart in peace, when his eyes had ſeen the Salvation of God, and his arms embraced it? Who would not be of the ſame mind that hath once taſted of the Cluſters of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Canaan</hi> to long after the full Vintage? How pathetical is that of <hi>Auſtin</hi> upon Gods anſwer to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Thou canſt not ſee my face, for no man can ſee me and live.</hi> Who replies with great confidence, Lord, is that all that I cannot ſee thy face and live? <hi>Eja Domine, moriar, ut te videam; videam, ut hic moriar, nolo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, volo mori, diſſolvi cupic, &amp; eſſecum Chriſto. I pray thee Lord then let me dye, that I may ſee thy face: Or let me ſee thee that I may dye in this place. I would not live, I would dye, I deſire to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt.</hi> Thus alſo have other Saints been affected, who have had death in deſire, and life in patience. O
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64536:75"/> what a ſtrange change then hath Chriſt made in <hi>death</hi> and the <hi>grave,</hi> and his grace in the <hi>heart</hi> and affections of Believers? Death, which ſin brought into the world, is now become the only means to deſtroy and kill ſin. Death, which is only contrary unto life, is now turned into a <hi>Port</hi> and paſſage into life: So that when we paſs out of this life we loſe neither life nor being, but are admitted to a more glorious life and being than ever we had. Death, that before was an armed <hi>Enemy,</hi> is now made a reconciled and firm <hi>friend,</hi> a <hi>Phyſician</hi> to cure all our diſeaſes, and an <hi>Harbinger</hi> to make way for glory. The Grave alſo by Chriſts lying in it, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>bed of reſt,</hi> in which his Saints fetch a ſhort <hi>ſlumber</hi> untill he awaken them to a glorious Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is the Chamber into which he invites his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ones, to hide themſelves untill his indignation be paſt; the <hi>Arke,</hi> into which he ſhuts his <hi>Noahs</hi> whileſt he deſtroyes the world with an overflowing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of his wrath and diſpleaſure. And therefore it is, that by his grace they are not afraid to meet Death, which others would ſhun, and make it as a voluntary <hi>offering</hi> unto God, which others pay only as a <hi>neceſſary debt.</hi> Yea, they eſteem it as one of the choiceſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels in that exact <hi>Inventory,</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> hath made of the riches of Believers, and next unto Jeſus Chriſt, bleſs God for it, as the greateſt mercy. O holy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, do thou then who art the Lord both of the dead and of the living, unto whom all ought to live, and all ought to dye, enable me thy ſervant to love <hi>thee</hi> above life, which of all bleſſings is the <hi>ſweetest,</hi> and to hate <hi>ſin</hi> above death, which of all evils is the <hi>bittereſt</hi> to nature: that ſo I may have this teſtimony of the power of thy grace in the change of my heart, that for the enjoyment of perfect Communion with thee I can gladly loſe my
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64536:75"/> life, and be ſeparated from ſin, can willingly undergo death, which is of all evidences the Cleareſt.</p>

               <head>Meditation XLIX. Vpon a Spring in an high ground.</head>
               <p>THe additional bleſſing, which <hi>Achſah</hi> ſought of <hi>Caleb</hi> her Father was Springs of water for her ſouth or dry land, who gave her the upper and the nether Springs: If the diſtinct recording of this particular in Scripture carry any thing of importance with it, is it not that he gave her ſome portion of Land that was well watered, as the low valleys for the moſt part are? And that he gave alſo ſuch Springs that by their high lying were apt to convey their ſtream to the enriching of other parts that ſtood in need of ſuch helps to make them fruitful. Now, what is it that can more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a Spring, than a free diffuſion of its waters, and the ſpreading of its moiſture, not only to grounds that are near, but to ſuch as are at a diſtance from it, and what can more conduce unto this commodious uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than the Springs <hi>riſe</hi> from ſome hill, or place of aſcent? <hi>Another Spring</hi> may haply ſerve to water ſome little ſpot of ground, to benefit ſome private Garden, but an <hi>upper Spring</hi> will greatly advantage a large <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</hi> Such a like difference methinks there is in the <hi>moral</hi> Well-ſprings of grace and holineſs, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>natural,</hi> according to the diverſity of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in which they are ſeated. <hi>Grace</hi> in a poor man is as a <hi>nether ſpring,</hi> which is not leſs uſeful through a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of water, but through an incapacity to make any
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64536:76"/> large communication of it, in regard of thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in which he ſtands: His <hi>wants,</hi> his <hi>paucity</hi> of Friends, the <hi>little notice</hi> the world takes of him, the <hi>ſlightings</hi> that Poverty expoſeth moſt men unto, are all great obſtacles to the <hi>eternal</hi> diffuſions of his grace, though not to his <hi>intrinſecal</hi> fulneſs of it. But grace in a great Perſon is like an <hi>upper Spring,</hi> which may convey it ſelf far and near, becauſe of the many advantages which he hath above others: His Counſels will be ſooner harkened unto, his Reproofs will over-awe more, his Converſation will win more, his Example having the force of a Law. So willing have many been to make Greatneſs their pattern, as that they have imitated their infirmities. <hi>Dyoniſius</hi> his Courtiers affected to ſeem to be purblind, and juſtle one againſt another, that ſo they might be like their Prince. <hi>Alexanders</hi> Followers would imitate him in their geſture, and go as if their ſhoulders were one higher than the other, becauſe there was ſome inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in his. Among the <hi>Perſians</hi> they were wont high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to eſteem a long and narrow head, and were indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious to faſhion the heads of their new-born Infants to ſuch a ſhape, becauſe ſome of their Kings heads were of that figure. O what pity is it then that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and goodneſs ſhould be ever out of Conjunction together, or be as Stars of a different Hemiſpheer, that are never ſeen ſhining at the ſame time? Yea, why ſhould not thoſe who are the higheſt among men affect alſo to be the beſt that ſo they might bring a beauty and ſhine into the world, that they might allure others not only to behold it, but alſo to imitate it, by conforming themſelves to their happy example? It is the ſaying of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that rare Moraliſt, That God is angry with them that counterfeit his Thunder and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64536:76"/> Lightning; his Scepter, and his Trident, and his Thunderbolts he would not have any to meddle with: He loves not that any ſhould imitate him in abſolute Dominion and Soveraignty: But he delights to ſee them darting forth thoſe amiable and cheriſhing beams of Juſtice, Goodneſs, and Clemency. Without theſe things be conveyed down unto others by thoſe who have the reines of Power and Government in their hands, though they look upon themſelves as Gods on earth, yet they are as unlike to the God of heaven as a blazing <hi>Comet</hi> is to a bright and glorious Sun, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful <hi>Glow-worm</hi> to an heavenly <hi>Star.</hi> What low thoughts <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf hath of Soveraignty when put into an ill hand, we may read in his Book of the <hi>Preacher,</hi> where he tells us, that <hi>better is a poor and a wiſe Child, than an old and fooliſh King who will not be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,</hi> to manage his power and authority for the good of thoſe that are under him. It is wiſdom that makes a mans face to ſhine, but moſt of all thoſe that are in higheſt places: Good in them is moſt conſpicuous, and both more applauded and Imitated than in others. What evil cannot a King forbid, <hi>whoſe wra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> is as the roaring of a Lion?</hi> What good can he not encourage, <hi>whoſe favour is as a cloud of the latter rain,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth an harveſt of bleſſings? I cannot but wonder at the great changes which the Scripture reports to have been made by godly Princes, in the midſt of a general Apoſtacy, ſuch as <hi>Aſa, Jehoſhaphat, Ezekiah, Joſiah</hi> who purged the Land from a ſpreading Idolatry, and reſtored Sabbaths, Ordinances, and Temple-worſhip to their power and purity, who have bowed the hearts of the people towards them, like to the top of a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers Angling rod, this way or that way as it pleaſeth them. Who but Princes that had grace in their hearts,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:64536:77"/> and power in their hands, could have ever effected ſuch things as might well ſeem to be of inſuperable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty? O that I could therefore ſuggeſt ſuch Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations that might prevail with all whoſe conditions God hath raiſed above others, to be accordingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in the doing of good to others that move in a lower ſpheer. Shall I ſay, God expects it from you? If I do, it is no other than what himſelf hath ſpoken, when he ſaith, <hi>He will get him up to the great men, for they have known the way of the Lord, and the Judgement of their God.</hi> Or ſhall I ſay, God ſignally commands it from you above others? Is it not to you that he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly calls? <hi>Be wiſe now O ye Kings, be inſtructed, ye Judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with trembling, kiſs the Son, leſt he be angry, and ye periſh from the way.</hi> Do you think, that greatneſs doth rather exempt from, than oblige to obedience, or that you ſhall have a more favourable Audit at the laſt Day, when every man muſt give an account of himſelf unto God? Be not deceived, God will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what you have done more for him above others, as he hath for you above thouſands, and woe be unto you if you be found too light. Your Exaltation in this life will ſerve only to make your caſting down to be the more diſmal in the other, and to confirm the truth of that Proverb, <hi>Inferni pavimentum fit ex magnatum galeis, Sacerdotum capitibus;</hi> That Hell is paved with the Corſlets of Noblemen, and the skulls of Prieſts.</p>

               <head>Meditation L. Vpon the vanity of Wiſhes.</head>
               <p>TRue and perfect happineſs is a good which neither the light of Nature can diſcover, nor its endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours obtain; it being as impotent to the acquiring of it, as it is blind to the beholding of it. And yet there is nothing in which man leſs apprehends himſelf at a loſs, than in this, of fully contriving at leaſt, if not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting his own happineſs. Who is it that is not confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that if he might have the liberty of his options to wiſh whatever he would, and to have them turned into realities for him; but that he could readily frame to himſelf a condition as full of happineſs, as the Sun is of light, or the Sea of water? What poor and contemptible thoughts would he have of all that glory of the world which the devil ſhewed to Chriſt as a bait, when he tempted him to the worſt of ſins, to thoſe ſtately Schemes and repreſentations, which he could ſuppoſe to be the objects of his delight? If wiſhes were the meaſure of happineſs, what is it that the boundleſs imagination of man would not ſuppoſe and deſire? What ſtrange changes would he forthwith make in the Univerſe, in levelling of Mountains, in raiſing of Vallies, in altering of Climates and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments themſelves? Happily he might wiſh that the Sea were turned into a delicious bath, in which he might ſport himſelf without any fear of drowning; that the Rocks were as ſo many poliſhed Diamond, the Sands as ſo many fair Pearls to beautifie it, and the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64536:78"/> Iſlands as ſo many retiring houſes of pleaſure to betake himſelf unto when he pleaſeth. He might wiſh that all the Trees of the earth were as the choiceſt plants of Paradiſe, every one of which might at his beck bow down their branches, and tender their ripe fruit unto him. And thus may he multiply his wiſhes, until every ſpire of Graſs, and every duſt of the earth have undergone ſome remarkable mutation according to the luſt of his fancy, and yet be as far from any ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in his deſires, or reſt in his thoughts, as the Apes in the Fable were from warmth, which finding a Glow-worm in a cold night, gathered ſome ſticks toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and blew themſelves breathleſs to kindle a little fire. For all theſe ſuppoſed gaieties, are not the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> but the <hi>diſeaſe</hi> of fancy, which hath (as I may ſo ſpeak) <hi>a Boulimia,</hi> in reſpect of objects, as ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and vitiated appetites have in reſpect of meats, who though they eat much are yet never ſatisfied. And hence it is, that men who enjoy plenty, and are far from having any juſt cauſe to complain of want, do yet, as unſatisfied perſons, feed themſelves with fond ſuppoſitions of being in ſuch an eſtate and condition of which they can have no poſſibility, much leſs any real hope for to obtain. The ambitious man pleaſeth himſelf in thinking how bravely he could King it, if he were but ſet upon a Throne, and how far he would out-ſtrip all other Princes that have been before him both for ſtate and glory; he fancies what pleaſures he would have for his recreation, what meats for his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, what perſons for his attendants, what Laws for his Government, and then, <hi>Abſolom</hi> like, he wiſheth in himſelf, <hi>O that I were made a Judge in Iſrael.</hi> The covetous perſon, whoſe heart is ſet upon Riches, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſeth in the midſt of his abundance to deſire
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64536:78"/> more. <hi>Riches</hi> and his <hi>deſires</hi> ſtill keep at a diſtance; as they come on, ſo do his deſires come on too, the one can never overtake the other, no more than the hinder wheels of a Coach can overtake the former. If he ſhould, as <hi>Peter,</hi> caſt his hook into the Sea, and take up the fiſh that firſt cometh up, with a Stater or piece of money in his mouth, how eagerly ſtraitwaies would he wiſh to take a ſecond, and then a third, yea, how would he ſtill renew his wiſhes, ſo as ſooner to empty the Sea of all its fiſh, than to ſatisfie his deſires with accumulated treaſures. But are theſe, O vain man, the higheſt wiſhes with which you would impe your preſent enjoyments, and ſo make your ſpeedy flight unto perfect happineſs? What if all theſe ſuppoſitions and wiſhes, which are (as I may ſo ſpeak) the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of fancy, were real exiſtency? Yea, what if your condition did as far exceed the pomp of all humane Imagination, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did the fame that was ſpread abroad of him? Might I not yet ſay, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>O ye Sons of men, how long will ye love vanity, and ſeek after leaſing?</hi> Are theſe things for which Angels will give you the right hand of fellowſhip? Or will this glory make them ſtoop to become miniſtring ſpirits un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you? Though you may conceive as highly of your ſelves, as the Prince of <hi>Tyrus</hi> did of himſelf, who ſaid <hi>he was a God,</hi> and ſate in the ſeat of God, yet they will look upon you no better than gilded duſt and aſhes. That which they adore, and with wonder look into, is not the happineſs of the <hi>worldings,</hi> but of <hi>believers,</hi> who are bleſſed, not according to what they ask or deſire, but far above whatever could have entred into the thoughts of men and Angels to conceive. Who could ever have ſaid to God, as <hi>Haman</hi> did to <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> if he had been asked, <hi>What ſhall be done to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64536:79"/> the man whom God delighteth to honour?</hi> Let the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and corner ſtone of his happineſs be laid in the exinanition of the Son of God, let him come from heaven to earth to purchaſe it with his bloud: let his nature be dignified by being perſonally united unto the Divine Nature, let him be a co-heir with him who is the brightneſs of his Fathers glory, ſit with him upon the ſame Throne, and be conformed to his likeneſs: let him ſtand for ever in the higheſt and ſweeteſt relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto the three moſt glorious Perſons, having God to be his <hi>Father,</hi> his Son to be his <hi>Elder Brother,</hi> and the Holy Spirit to be his <hi>Friend</hi> and <hi>Comforter,</hi> are not theſe things ſuch, as may poſe Angels to tell whether is greater the <hi>wonder</hi> or the <hi>mercy?</hi> May it not be truly ſaid, that Omnipotency it ſelf is exhauſted, ſo that there remains neither power in God to do, nor wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to find out a greater happineſs than this, which he hath vouchſafed to man in his loweſt condition? Can there then be any additions made by the narrow conceptions of weak Creatures? Let me therefore expoſtulate with Chriſtians, whoſe happineſs in Chriſt is compleat, and yet, as if there were an emptineſs in their condition, are ſtill hankering in their minds after the worlds vanities, and wiſhing, like carnal <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to eat of the Fleſh-pots and Garlick of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as if the true bread from heaven were not a ſufficient and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying food. Is there any thing in the world which you cannot find made up to you in Chriſt? Are not all the ſcattered comforts which can be had only in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by retaile, as being parcelled out ſome to one and ſome to another, to be had fully in Chriſt, in whom they are ſummed up, as broken particulars are in the foot of an account? Though he be, <hi>Bonum for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliter ſimplex,</hi> a good formally ſimple, yet he is,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64536:79"/> 
                  <hi>Eminenter multiplex.</hi> A good eminently manifold. And there is more to be had in Chriſt, than can be had any waies out of him; who, as the firſt figure in a number, ſtands for more than all the figures that can be added unto it. <hi>Whom,</hi> ſaith holy <hi>David, have I in heaven but thee? And there is none upon earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi> Surely, if Heaven, which hath legions of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and perfections in it, yield nothing worthy of his love and affection but God and Chriſt, we may well conclude, that Earth, which is as void of good, as Heaven is full, can have nothing in it that is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by us. Why then ſhould any, in whom Chriſt is the hope of glory, be as the men of the world, who cry out, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> For them to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied who feed upon vanities is no wonder; but for thoſe who poſſeſs him that is, and hath all things, it is ſtrange that they ſhould ſeek any thing out of him. <hi>Quid ultra quaerit, cui omnia ſuus conditor fit? aut quid ei ſuſficit, cui ipſe non ſufficit?</hi> What can be ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>VVHat the Apoſtle ſaith of the heavenly Bodies, that one <hi>Star</hi> differeth from another Star in glory, is true alſo of the heavenly <hi>Laws</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, as well <hi>Ceremonial</hi> as <hi>Moral,</hi> that they differ from each other in their <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>worth.</hi> Some of which ſet forth the <hi>greater</hi> things, and others the <hi>leſs;</hi> as may be eaſily ſeen in this double Command of <hi>First</hi> fruits, and Gleanings; one of which is far greater than the other, though the leſs is not to be neglected, becauſe it is a ſtream that flows from the ſame Fountain, the Soveraign will and appointment of God. But that we may the better take the Dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Law of <hi>Firſt fruits,</hi> let us view it by the help of ſome Conſiderations, as Aſtronomers by inſtruments judge of the Altitude, and Magnitude of a Star. We may firſt ſee it in the extent of thoſe things in the offering of which God would be honoured and acknowledged; he required <hi>the firſtlings of Men and Cattel, the firſt fruits of trees, and of the Earth, in the ſheaf, and in the threſhing floor, in the dough, and in the loaves.</hi> It did reach to all their Subſtance, and the encreaſe, which without this Service was but a polluted and an unclean heap.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the ſolemn manner of the offering of them unto God, which was to be done with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Confeſſion of their Fathers poverty; <hi>A Syrian ready to periſh was my Father,</hi> and of the hard bondage
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64536:80"/> in <hi>Egypt</hi> ſuſtained by them, and with acknowledgment of Gods gracious looking upon their Affliction, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and Oppreſſion, bringing them alſo forth with a mighty hand and out-ſtretched arm, with great ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribleneſs, and with ſigns and wonders, and giving them a Land that floweth with milk and honey.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the expreſs command for the ſpeedy payment of them, they were not to be <hi>delayed,</hi> much leſs <hi>withheld;</hi> to keep them back was <hi>robbery,</hi> to defer them was <hi>diſobedience,</hi> and rendred them rather to be of the <hi>Gleanings</hi> and <hi>Corners of the field,</hi> which God had appointed to be reſerved for the poor; then of the <hi>Firſt fruits</hi> which he required for himſelf. It was an injury to the <hi>moral</hi> duty which they did teach of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating to God the firſt and prime of their years, and abilities, which is to him far more acceptable than all Offerings and Sacrifices whatever; for how could it be, that he who was careleſs of the <hi>Rite</hi> and <hi>Ceremony,</hi> which typified his duty to him, ſhould ever be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of doing that which was the marrow and ſubſtance of it. And now when I think that <hi>Firſt fruits</hi> only were the <hi>ſhadow</hi> of our early honouring God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring him in the day of our youth, when all the faculties both of ſoul and body are in their vigour and ſtrength. I cannot but wonder, as well as mourn, to ſee that under the Doctrine of the Goſpel, which reacheth men to deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, that thereby they might become a kind of <hi>firſt fruits unto God and the Lamb.</hi> So few make Religion the work of the morning of their Age, and ſo many of the Evening. What elſe is this, but to give the <hi>Firſt fruits</hi> to Satan, and the <hi>Gleanings</hi> to God; To him the fineſt of the <hi>flower,</hi> and to God the <hi>bran?</hi> But tell me, O ye deferrers of holineſs, who make it
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64536:81"/> both the leaſt and the laſt work of your lives. Is it only neceſſary to die to God, and not 10 live to him? Or is it reaſonable to ſay as that young man did to his Companion, when he ſaw <hi>Ambroſe</hi> dying, <hi>Tecum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verem &amp; cum Ambroſio moriar,</hi> I would live with thee, and dye with <hi>Ambroſe?</hi> Is not this to mock God, whom yet you would have to ſave you? And to miniſter matter of triumph to the God of this world, whoſe Captives you have been, that though the God of heaven pay you your wages, yet you have done wholly his work? Unto you therefore, O men, I call, and my voice is unto the Sons of men, be not deceived, God will not be mocked: It is not the owning of him when you can ſerve neither your ſelves, nor your Luſts any longer, that will be acceptable unto him: It is not a few bedrid prayers, that are as thoſe Ears of Corn which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaw in his dream, withered, thin, and blaſted with the Eaſt wind, that will expiate thoſe black Crimes with which your ill-ſpent life is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread. Can an Offering of <hi>Gleanings,</hi> which is made up of <hi>robbery,</hi> and <hi>diſobedience,</hi> of wronging the poor, and violating the Command of God, ever hallow the whole Harveſt? No more can ſuch duties be availing to reconcile you to God, who requires that you ſhould ſeek him early. Yea, hath he not curſed the deceiver, which hath in his Flock a Male, and ſacrificeth to the Lord a corrupt thing? And what are you but deceivers? Who waſte the Lamp of time that God hath given you to work by, in the ſinful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the fleſh and <hi>alienate</hi> the chief of your ſtrength and parts from him that ſhould have been honoured, both with the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>beſt</hi> of your abilities, and in your Age have nothing to offer to him, but a large bedroll of hainous enormities, which may juſtly bring
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64536:81"/> down your gray haires with ſorrow unto the grave? How bleſſed a thing is it then for Men to give to God the <hi>firſt-fruits</hi> of their Youth, that he may not give them bitter <hi>after-fruits,</hi> and cauſe them to feel more ſmart of their ſins in their Old Age, then ever they found pleaſure or delight in them in their Youth? and what better Perſwaſions can I ſuggeſt, then to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</p>
               <p>

               <p>IT is the ſaying of the <hi>Moraliſts,</hi> That Accidents which befall Men have a double handle, by which they may be apprehended; So as that if they be rightly taken, they become not onely leſs burthenſome and unpleaſant, but alſo of uſe and advantage to thoſe that ſuſtain them: like bitter Herbes that are by the skill of the Phyſician turned into a wholſome Medicine. The like may be ſaid of this preſent Subject, that it hath a double aſpect under which it may be repreſented to our Conſideration, each of which will ſuggeſt thoughts far differing one from another, and yet both have their riſe from Scripture. Doth not God bid us <hi>look unto the rock from whence we are hewen, and to the pit whence we are digged?</hi> And then what can it hold out to our view, but the miſery of our natural condition, our dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, deformity, barrenneſs, and untractableneſs to any good? Is it not the complaint of the beſt, that their hearts are Stony and Rocky, and that they are apt to ſtand it out with God, and not to yield to the Work of his Grace? is there any evil that in their account is more inſuperable then a flinty heart? When did <hi>Moſes,</hi> who had faith to work many Miracles, moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, but when he was to make the Rock to yield Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? though God commanded him to <hi>ſpeak</hi> onely to it; yet, as deeming it inſufficient he <hi>ſmote</hi> it twice. And yet is it not the Promiſe of God to take away the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64536:83"/> ſtony heart, and to give an heart of fleſh? And is it not that which I beg, that God would mollifie both my <hi>Naturall</hi> and <hi>Acquired</hi> hardneſs, and preſerve me from <hi>Judiciall</hi> hardneſs; That ſo I may not reſiſt <hi>Pharoah.</hi> like his <hi>Meſſages,</hi> his <hi>Miracles,</hi> his <hi>Judgments,</hi> and his <hi>Mercies,</hi> and grow worſe in ſtead of being better. I would that God might be a <hi>Rock</hi> to me; but I would be as <hi>Wax</hi> unto him, that ſo I might be apt to receive Divine Impreſſions from him. It is my ſin to be as a Rock to God, unflexible and ſooner <hi>Broken</hi> then <hi>Bent;</hi> But it is my unſpeakable comfort to think that God will be a Rock to me, who ſtand in a continual need of his aide and power, to uphold me, who, if I be not built upon him, cannot ſubſiſt; and if I be not hid in him can have no ſalvation. I cannot therefore but give ſome ſcope and line to my thoughts, that I may the better take in the honey and ſweetneſs that drops from this <hi>Metaphoricall</hi> Name of God, who is often ſtiled in Scripture, the <hi>Rock of Iſrael;</hi> the <hi>Rock of Ages;</hi> the <hi>Rock of Salvation.</hi> But here I muſt uſe the help of the Schooles, who rightly informe us, that when any thing of the Creature is applyed to God, it muſt be, <hi>via re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motionis,</hi> by way of remotion; and <hi>via eminentiae,</hi> by way of tranſcendent eminency.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by way of <hi>remotion:</hi> All defects and blemiſhes whatſoever are not in the leaſt to be attributed unto him who is abſolutely perfect; as <hi>Heraulds</hi> ſay of <hi>Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> the reſemblance muſt be taken from the beſt of their properties, and not from the worſt. Is a Rock deformed, and of unequall parts? God is the firſt of Beauties, as well as of Beings, and all his attributes are equally infinite; his Juſtice is of as large extent as his Mercy; and his Wiſdom as his Power. Is a Rock unſenſible of the ſtraits of thoſe that fly unto it for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour?
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64536:83"/> ſo is not God, who is both a Rock and a Father of <hi>Mercies:</hi> Who can read the expreſſions of his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </p>
               <p>Is the ſtrength of a Rock intranſient, and fixed in it ſelf, not communicating its ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ue to what lies upon it? So is not the ſtrength of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who is a <hi>living,</hi> and not <hi>a dead</hi> Rock, and gives both life and power to thoſe that are united to him. <hi>I can do all things</hi> (ſaith holy <hi>Paul) through Chriſt ſtrengthning me.</hi> Is a Rock Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and can yield no <hi>food,</hi> though it afford <hi>ſhelter;</hi> So is not God, who is a <hi>full ſtore-houſe,</hi> as well as a <hi>free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge;</hi> a <hi>Sun</hi> as well as a <hi>Shield.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>By way of Eminency,</hi> all perfections whatſoever, either for <hi>degree</hi> or <hi>kind,</hi> which put a worth or value upon the Creature, are to be found inſinitely more in God. Is a Rock ſtrong, and daſhing in pieces all reſiſtance made againſt it? God is incomparably more: He (ſaith <hi>Job) is wiſe in heart, and mighty in ſtrength, who hath hardened himſelf againſt him and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered?</hi> Is a Rock durable, and not ſubject to change, by the many revolutions of Ages that paſs over it? God is far more immutable, his yeares are throughout all Generations: he is the ſame yeſeerday, and to day, and for ever: <hi>In the Lord Jehovah is everlaſting ſtrength.</hi> Is the ſhadow of a great Rock deſirable in a weary Land, to bear off the ſcorchings of the Sun, and to revive the fainting Traveller? what a covert and hiding place then is God, againſt all ſtormes, and heates whatſoever, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed either by the rage of Men, or by the Eſtuations of a troubled Conſcience, and fomented by the Malice of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64536:84"/> Satan? Is a Rock of an awfull aſpect for its height, and apt to work upon the head of him that looks down from the top of it? How great then is God whoſe glory is above the Heavens? whoſe faithfulneſs reacheth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cloudes, whoſe righteouſneſs is like the great Mountaines, and whoſe Judgments are a great deep? And now methinks I may ſay to my Soul, as <hi>David</hi> did unto his, <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my Soul? and why art thou diſquieted within me?</hi> Cannot God keep him in perfect peace, whoſe Minde is ſtayed on him? is not he a very preſent help in the times of trouble? what evil can befall me, under which his everlaſting Armes cannot ſupport me? What Seas of Tryalls can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm when God ſhall ſet me upon a Rock that is higher than I? As I my ſelf cannot climbe it, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can my Enemies power ever reach it. A Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can onely be wounded by his own feares; as the Diamond is onely cut by its own duſt. <hi>Peter</hi> ſunk not till his Faith failed him: if his confidence had riſen, as the Winde and Billowes did, he would have greatly honoured his Lord, as his Rock, upon whom he was built, and have been highly commended by him, as he was for the good Confeſſion he made of him.</p>
               <p>But, O bleſſed Saviour, if <hi>Peter</hi> cry out, <hi>Save Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter I periſh,</hi> how much more ſhall I, who fall far ſhort of his little Faith? and am apt to fear, not onely in the <hi>deep Seas,</hi> but in the <hi>ſhallow Brookes:</hi> not onely when the <hi>Waves roar,</hi> but when the <hi>petty Streames</hi> murmur? Do thou therefore, holy Lord, teach me to know what a Rock thou art, and cauſe all thy glory to paſs before me, as thou didſt before <hi>Moſes,</hi> that ſo I may ſee every attribute of thine, as ſo many Clefts in the Rock, to which I may run in time of danger, and rejoyce to find how I am compaſſed about, with thy power, wiſdome,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64536:84"/> faithfulneſs, and goodneſs, from whence more ſure comfort will ariſe, than if a numerous hoſt of <hi>Angells</hi> ſhould pitch their Tents round about me.</p>

Is it not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to bid the moſt watchful to take heed of a <hi>Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi> when the Wiſe Virgins are fallen aſleep? Did not Chriſt himſelf Caution his Diſciples againſt having their hearts at any time over-charged with ſurfeting and drunkenneſs, and the Cares of this life? And yet the meaneſt of their Condition might ſeem to exempt them from ſuch Snares? From whence then is it that the welfare and health of the Body ſhould be more ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly endeavoured by all, then the well-being of the Soul in its Peace and Serenity is almoſt by any? Is it not from the ſtrength of fleſhly Principles which abide
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64536:87"/> in the beſt, and darken oft times the eye of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that it cannot rightly apprehend its own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments? If there were but a clear inſight into that Bleſſedneſs, into which Peace of Conſcience doth Eſtate a Believer, it could not be but that it being laid in the Ballance with the health of the Body, it ſhould as far over-weigh it, as a full Bucket a ſingle drop; or as the Vintage of Wine a particular Cluſter: True it is, that health of Body is the <hi>Salt</hi> of all outward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, which without it have no reliſh or ſavour; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Riches nor Honours, nor Delights for the Belly or Back, can yield the leaſt Pleaſure where this is wanting; So that the enjoyment of it alone may well be ſet againſt many other Wants. And better it is to enjoy health without other additional-comforts, then to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them under a load of Infirmities. And yet I may ſtill ſay, <hi>Quid Palea ad Triticum?</hi> What is the Chaff to the Wheat? Though it be the greateſt outward good that God beſtowes in this Life, it is nothing to that Peace which paſſeth all underſtanding? Sickneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes it, Age enfeebles it, and Extremities imbitter it. But it is the Excellency of this divine Peace that it worketh joy in Tribulation, that it ſupports in Bodily languiſhments, and creates confidence in death. Who is it that can throw forth the Gauntler, and bid defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to Armies of Trialls, to perſecution, diſtreſs, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, nakedneſs, peril and ſword; But he whoſe heart is eſtabliſhed with this Peace? the ground of which is Gods free love; the Price of which is Chriſts ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; the Worker of which is the Holy Spirit; and the Subject of which is a Good Conſcience. This was it that filled old <hi>Simeons</hi> heart with joy, and made him to beg a Dimiſſion of his Saviour, whom his eyes had ſeen, his armes embraced, and his Soul truſted in.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64536:88"/> What a ſtrange thing is it then, that there ſhould be ſo few Marchant-men that ſeek this goodly Pearl, which is far above all the Treaſures of the Earth, that are either hid in it, or extracted from it? Many ſay, Who will ſhew us any good? but it is <hi>David</hi> onely that Prayes, <hi>Lord lift up the light of thy Countenance upon us.</hi> Others like the ſcattered <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> go up and down gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Straw and Stubble; when he, like an <hi>Iſraelite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi> in the Wilderneſs of this World, ſeeks <hi>Manna,</hi> which his Spirit gathers up and feeds upon with delight; and then cries out, <hi>Thou haſt put gladneſs in my heart, more then in the time, that their Corn and their Wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</hi> It is the love of God ſhed abroad in the heart, that doubleth the ſweetneſs of proſperity, and ſweetens alſo the bitterneſs of aſfliction: A wonder onely therefore it is, not that few ſhould ſeek, but a much greater, that any in this World ſhould live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.

And yet there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places wherein ſuch Perſons may lie hid in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, when the utmoſt ends of the Earth cannot ſecure them againſt Gods frownes. But if any be ſo profligate as <hi>Cleopatria-</hi>like to diſſolve this Jewel of Peace in his Luſts, and to drink down, in one prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous draught, that which exceeds the World, in its price, and yet think they can live well enough without it; let them conſider how they will do to die without it.

That for which the Glaſs is to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is the true and genuine reſemblance which it makes of the object which is ſeen in it, when it neither flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Face, by giving any falſe Beauty to it, nor yet injures it, by detracting ought from it. To ſlight then or neglect the Glaſs for the meanneſs of its Caſe, and to value it onely for its Gaiety, is no better then
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64536:89"/> the folly of Children, or the bruitiſh Ignorance of thoſe, who prize the Book by the <hi>Cover,</hi> and not by the <hi>Learning</hi> that is in it. To quarrel at the Glaſs for its returning a moſt exact and abſolute likeneſs of the Face that is ſeen in it, is to deſpiſe it for its excellency, and can come from no other ground, than a conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome guilt. Is it not for this very reſpect, that beautiful perſons both prize it, and uſe it happily too much? It being the only means whereby they come to be acquainted with their own comlineſs, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what it is that allures the hearts and eyes of all towards them. Who then but thoſe whoſe features Nature hath drawn with a <hi>Cole,</hi> rather than a <hi>Pencil,</hi> or whom age and ſickneſs have robbed of what they formerly prided themſelves in, ſhun the familiar uſe of it? Or be angry when they look into it, as if it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided them, rather than reſembled them? <hi>Phryne,</hi> the famous Harlot, throws paſſionately away her Glaſs, ſaying, <hi>Qualis ſum nolo, qualis eram nequeo;</hi> As I am I will not, as I was I cannot behold my ſelf: And yet is not this anger againſt the Glaſs cauſeleſs? Doth it make the gray hairs on the head? Or the pock-holes and wrinkles in the face? Or doth it diſcover only what Age and Diſeaſes have done? And let them ſee what they cannot conceal from the eyes of others? Now, what doth all this argue, but an averſeneſs in men to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the truth of their own condition, and a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs through ſelf-flattery to deceive themſelves in thinking of what ever they have above what is meet? Great muſt needs be the impatiency againſt truth, when the ſilent reflections of a Glaſs, that vaniſh as ſoon as it is turned from, kindle ſuch diſlikes in the breaſt as to make them to caſt it from them, for doing only the ſame thing to them which it doth to others. Here
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64536:90"/> methinks we may learn the ground, why carnal men are offended at the Word, both in putting ſcorn and contempt upon it, by the low and mean thoughts they have of it, or elſe by the anger which they expreſs againſt it, in throwing this bleſſed Mirrour from them, in as great, though not ſo good, an heat as <hi>Moſes</hi> did the Tables which he brake beneath the Mount. Some pick a quarrel with the plainneſs of the Word, as if it wholly wanted thoſe Embroideries of Wit and Art that other writings and diſcourſes abound with, and had none of thoſe quaint and taking Expreſſions that might win upon the affections of them that converſe with it. But is not this to make ſuch uſe of the Word as Young Children do of the Glaſs, more to behold the Babies in their own eyes, than to make any obſervance of themſelves? Is the Word writ or preached, to have its reflections upon the <hi>Fancy,</hi> or upon the <hi>Conſcience?</hi> Is it to inform only the <hi>head,</hi> or to reform the <hi>heart?</hi> If the inward man be the proper Subject of it, the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of it conduceth more to that great end than the <hi>Contemperation</hi> of it with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane mixtures. It is not the <hi>painted,</hi> but the <hi>Chryſtal</hi> Glaſs by which the object is beſt diſcerned. Others again are not a little diſpleaſed with the Law or Word of God, becauſe when that they look into it both their <hi>perſons</hi> and <hi>ſins</hi> are repreſented in a far differing manner from thoſe conceptions they ever had of the one or of the other. In their own eyes they are, as <hi>Abſoloms,</hi> without any blemiſh; but in this Glaſs they appear as deformed <hi>Lepers,</hi> and ſpread with an univerſal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, and who can bear it to ſee himſelf thus ſuddenly transformed into a Monſter? Now, their ſins, which they judged to be as little as the Motes in the Sun-beams, appear in amazing dimenſions, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64536:90"/> it is to them, not a <hi>Looking-glaſs,</hi> but a <hi>Magnifying glaſs.</hi> Thoughts of the heart, glances of the eye, words of the lips, the irruptions of the paſſions are all cenſured by it, as deſerving death, and there is nothing can eſcape it, which as a Rule it will not guide, or as a Judge condemn. O how irkſome muſt this needs be to carnal and unregenerate men, who abound with ſelf-ſlatteries, and preſumptions of their own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and righteouſneſs, who can with as little pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence endure the convincing power of the Word as ſore eyes can the ſevere ſearchings of the light? We need not then wonder that the Word hath ſo many Adverſaries, who take part with <hi>Nature</hi> againſt <hi>Grace,</hi> ſetting their wits on work by diſtinctions, and blended interpretations, to make it as a Glaſs breathed and blown upon, which yields nothing but dim and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect reflections. Is there any thing that the Word doth more clearly aſſert than the loathſome condition of mans Nature with which he comes into the world? Is it not expreſſed by the filthineſs of the birth which every Child is encompaſſed with when it breaks forth from the Womb? Is it not reſembled to the rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtench of the Grave into which man is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved when he is ſaid to be dead in ſins and treſpaſſes? And yet how many when they view themſelves in this Glaſs give out to the World that they can ſee no ſuch thing? <hi>Celeſtius</hi> of old thought that original ſin was <hi>Res queſtionis, non fidci,</hi> matter rather of diſpute, than of faith. And ſome of late have been more bold, calling it <hi>Auſtins figment.</hi> But the more injurious others are to this Divine Mirrour of truth, the more it behoves every good Chriſtian to be ſtudious in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating it from the ſcorns of ſuch that deſpiſe it for its <hi>ſimplicity,</hi> and from the impieties of others that ſeek
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64536:91"/> to corrupt its <hi>purity:</hi> and to ſhew that for what cauſe others hate it, he moſt affectionately love; and prizeth it. <hi>Thy word is very pure,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) therefore thy Servant loveth it.</hi> Can you do God better ſervice, while you honour his Word, which he hath magnified above all his name? Or can you do your ſelves more right, than to judge your ſelves by that which is ſo pure that it neither can deceive, nor be deceived. What though it preſent you with the ſad ſpectacle of your ſins, which may juſtly fill you with ſhame and ſelf-ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency; doth it not ſhew unto you alſo your Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who is made unto us, Wiſdom, and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Sanctification, and Redemption? And cannot this joyful ſight raiſe you more than the other can caſt you down? O fear not to ſee your ſin, when you may at the ſame time behold your Saviour? A mourning heart is the beſt preparation for ſpiritual joy, and ſerves to intend the height of it, as dark colours do to ſet off the Gold that is laid upon them. Give me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O Lord, a broken and relenting heart, that Sin may be my Sorrow, and Chriſt may be my Joy; let all my tears drop from the eye of faith, that I may not mourn without hope, nor yet rejoyce without trembling.

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64536:92"/> the great <hi>distance</hi> in which they ſtand from heaven, and to the other, the good <hi>proficiency</hi> they have made, which is oft times as indiſcernable to themſelves, as the ſwift motion of the Ship is to them that are in it. There being no Complaint more frequent in the mouths of Saints, than that they have got no farther, than what many years ſince they judged themſelves to have attained unto. The <hi>natural</hi> mans diſtance is far greater than he thinks of, ſo that he cannot eaſily ſtep into Heaven as he preſumes. He is not born near its Conſines or Borders; but in the very extremity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteneſs from it. The diſtance is not only a diſtance of <hi>place,</hi> but of <hi>diſproportion,</hi> and <hi>unlikeneſs,</hi> whereby he is wholly unmeet for it: Yea, there is in him not only a <hi>diſſimilitude,</hi> but a formal <hi>contrariety</hi> and <hi>oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> againſt heaven, which muſt be deſtroyed and taken away before he can come thither.

Doth not the ſtraitneſs of the way, and the height of its aſcent, require a putting off, and a caſting away, every ſin that hinders from running the Chriſtian Race, and aſcending the holy Hill? Is it not neceſſary, that the oppoſition and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude extending it ſelf over the whole man, that an anſwerable change ſhould be made in every part?

               <p>But I fear that while I propound the difficulties, which are great, as well as many, intending thereby to ſhake only the Pillars of thoſe mens Confidence, who conſider neither the length of the way, nor the hardneſs of the task by which Salvation is attained; that I may diſhearten others, who, after all their travel and labour, complain that they have ſtriven much and gained little; and that their hopes of laying hold on Eternal life do rather languiſh than encreaſe, doubting that the Journey is much too long for their ſhort life to finiſh. Gladly therefore I would lift up the hands which hang down, and ſtrengthen the feeble knees, that they might be animated in the way, and not deſpair of the end. Now how can this be better done, than by giving ſuch Signs and Evidences that will beſt ſerve to manifeſt their motion and proficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; the not diſcerning of which is the ground of thoſe fears of their ſpending their ſtrength in vain, and their labouring for nought?

If any thing make this Subject difficult to my Meditation, it is not <hi>want</hi> but <hi>plenty,</hi> which is ſo great, as that I muſt, like <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab,</hi> be forced to lay aſide much of that coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtuff which preſents it ſelf to me. And what to refuſe, or what to take in, is no eaſie matter to reſolve. It will, I am ſenſible, require and deſerve alſo more exactneſs in chuſing what to ſay, and what not to ſay, concerning its worth and excellency, and how to digeſt what is ſpoken, than what is meet for any to aſſume unto himſelf. I ſhall therefore account that I have attained, my end, if I can but ſo imploy my thoughts as to encreaſe my veneration to this Book of God, which none can ever too much ſtudy, or too highly prize; and with which to be well acquainted, is not only the chief of <hi>duties,</hi> but the beſt of <hi>delights,</hi> and pleaſures.

               <p>True it is, that for many years God made known himſelf by <hi>Viſions, Dreams, Oracles,</hi> to perſons of <hi>noted holineſs,</hi> that they might teach and inſtruct others; But it was while the Church of God was of ſmall growth and extent, and the perſons to whom Gods Meſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But afterward the Lord ſpake to his Church both by <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Writing,</hi> the one uſeful for further <hi>revealing</hi> Divine Truths, and the other for the <hi>recording</hi> of them, that when the <hi>Canon</hi> was once compleated, all might appeal unto it, and none take the liberty of coyning Divine <hi>Oracles</hi> to himſelf, or of obtruding his <hi>fancies</hi> upon others.</p>
               <p>And were there no other uſe of this <hi>Book of God</hi> than this, that it ſhould be the Standard for the trial of all Doctrines, it were to be highly prized for its worth; without which the minds of men would be in a continual diſtraction, through the multitude of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts,</hi> that would be pretending <hi>Commiſſions</hi> from heaven, none knowing what to believe in point of Faith, or what to do in point of Obedience, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to difference the <hi>good and evil Spirit</hi> from each other. But this ſingle benefit (though it can never enough be thankfully acknowledged to God by us) is but as a Cluſter to the Vintage, or as an Ear of Corn to the Harveſt, in reſpect of thoſe many bleſſings that may
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:64536:95"/> be reaped from it. Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> aſcribe unto it an univerſal influence into the Welfare of Believers, when he ennumerates ſo many noble Ends for which all Scripture is profitable? What is it that makes any man wiſe to Salvation? Is it not the Scripture? What is it that inſtructs any in Righteouſneſs, and makes him perfect, and throughly furniſhed unto all good works? Is it not the Scripture? Is not this the only Bock by which we come to underſtand the heart of God to us, and learn alſo the knowledge of our own hearts? Both which as they are the breaſts of myſteries; ſo they are of all knowledge the beſt, and fill the ſoul with more ſatisfaction than the moſt exact diſcovery of all created Beings whatſoever. What if a man could, like <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſpeak of Trees, from the <hi>Cedar</hi> that is in <hi>Lebanon</hi> to the <hi>Hyſop</hi> that groweth upon the Wall, and of Beaſts, Fowls, and Fiſhes, and yet were wholly ignorant of his own heart, would not the light that is in him be darkneſs? Or what if a man could reſolve all thoſe poſing queſtions in which the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have buſied themſelves concerning Angels, and yet know nothing of the God of Angels, would he not become as a ſounding Braſs, and a tinckling Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal? Is the knowledge of theſe things the great end for which our underſtanding was given unto us? Or is it any further deſirable or profitable than as it condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to the knowledge of God? Doth the <hi>rectitude</hi> of our actions, and the <hi>holineſs</hi> of them, flow from the knowledge we have of any Creature, or from the knowledge of God? Is not his Will the Rule, and his Glory the End of all that we do? And how ſhould we ever come to know what the good and acceptable will of God is, but by his revealing it unto us? Which he hath done moſt clearly and fully in this bleſſed Book
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64536:95"/> of his, <hi>the Scripture of truth.</hi> That then which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends this Book, and renders it worthy of all accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, is the rich diſcoveries that it makes to us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſo <hi>Excellent a Being</hi> as God is, whom it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us with in his <hi>Nature, Perfections, Counſels,</hi> and <hi>Deſigns,</hi> in relation to the Eternal Salvation of man. It contains not any thing that is mean or trivial; the matters in it are all of no leſs glory for any to behold, than of weighty <hi>importance</hi> for all to know.</p>

Great things are recorded in Sacred Hiſtory to be done by ſome of <hi>Iſraels Judges,</hi> and <hi>Davids Worthies,</hi> which would be looked upon as impoſſibilities, if the Spirit of God were not the Voucher of the Truth of them. <hi>Shamgar</hi> ſlew ſix hundred <hi>Philiſtims</hi> with an Ox Goad; <hi>Sampſon</hi> with the Jaw-bone of an Aſs laid Heapes upon Heapes; and <hi>Adino</hi> the <hi>Tachmonite</hi> lifted up his Spear againſt eight hundred, whom he ſlew at one time. But if theſe, and the like remarkable Acquiſts, which others alſo are famed for, and have their Names Enrolled in the Liſt of Worthies, were as ſeveral Parcells brought into one Totall, how far ſhort would the foot of the Account be, in regard of this number which fell by the Sword of one Angell?

               <head>Meditation LIX. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon going to Bed.</head>
               <p>HOw like is the frail <hi>Life</hi> of Man to a <hi>Day,</hi> as well for the <hi>inequality</hi> of its length, as the <hi>mixture</hi> that it hath both of Cloudes and Sun-ſhine? VVhat a kinde of exact <hi>Parelia</hi> are <hi>Sleep</hi> and <hi>Death;</hi> the one being the <hi>ligation</hi> of the Senſes, and the other the <hi>Privation</hi> of them? And of how near a kin is the <hi>Grave</hi> to the <hi>Bed,</hi> when the Scripture calls it by the ſame Name? when the <hi>Clothes</hi> that cover us do the like office with the <hi>Mould,</hi> that muſt be caſt and ſpread over us? VVhen therefore the <hi>Day,</hi> and the <hi>Labours</hi> which Man goeth forth unto are ended, and the darkneſs of the Night diſpoſeth unto Reſt; what thoughts can any better take into his Boſome to lie down with? then to think, that Death, like the Beaſts of the Forreſt may creep forth to ſeek its prey, and that when it comes there is no reſiſtance to be made, or delay to be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It ſpares no rank of Men; but ſlayes the <hi>rich</hi> as well as the <hi>poor,</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> as well as the <hi>peaſant:</hi> The Glaſs that hath the Kings Face painted on it, is not the leſs brittle; neither are Kings, that have Gods Image repreſented in them the leſs mortal. And whether it comes in at the <hi>window,</hi> or at the <hi>door,</hi> whether in ſome Common, or in ſome unwonted manner who can tell? Many oft times fall aſleep in this World, and awake in the other, and have no Summons at all to acquaint them whither they are going. And yet though every Mans condition be thus uncertain, and that his Breath is in
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64536:100"/> his Noſtrils, where there is as much room for it to go out, as to come in; how few do make their nights re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſerve as a <hi>memorial</hi> of their laſt reſt? on their Bed to ſtand for a <hi>model</hi> of their Coffin? Some pervert the Night, which was ordained to be a Ceſſation of the evils of Labour, to make it a ſeaſon for their greater activity in the evils of ſin. <hi>They deviſe</hi> (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith) <hi>iniquity upon their Beds, and when the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is light they practiſe it, becauſe it is in the power of their hand.</hi> Other are eaſily brought aſleep, by the riot and intemperance of the day, owning their unhappy reſt not to the dew of nature, but unto the groſs and foul va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours of ſin, which more darken and eclipſe their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than their ſleep? their <hi>Dreames</hi> having more of it in them than their <hi>Diſcourſe.</hi> Others again by their youth and health ſeem to be ſeated in ſuch an elevation above death; as that they cannot look down from their <hi>Bed</hi> into the <hi>Grave</hi> without growing dizzy, ſuch a ſteep Precipice they apprehend between life and death? Though this diſtemper doth not ariſe from the diſtance between the two termes, but from the imbecillity of their ſenſe, which cannot bear the leaſt thoughts of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from thoſe delights and pleaſures to which their Soules are firmly wedded. VVhen therefore the moſt of men are ſuch unthrifts of time, and like careleſs Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigators keep no <hi>Journal</hi> or <hi>Diary</hi> of their motions, and other occurrences that fall our. VVhat need have others to make the Prayer of <hi>Moſes the Man of God,</hi> their Prayer? <hi>So teach us to number our dayes, that we may apply our hearts unto wiſdom.</hi> He who was Learned in all the Sciences of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> deſires to be taught this point of <hi>Arithmetick</hi> of God; <hi>ſo to number,</hi> as not to miſtake, or make any error in the account of life, in ſetting down <hi>dayes</hi> for <hi>minutes,</hi> and <hi>yeares</hi> for <hi>dayes.</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:64536:101"/> A Man would think that a little <hi>Arithmetick</hi> would ſerve caſt up ſo ſmall a number, as the dayes of him, whoſe dayes are as the dayes of an hireling, few and evill? and yet it is ſuch a Myſtery, that <hi>Moſes</hi> begs of God to be inſtructed in it, as that which is the chief and onely knowledge. Yea, God himſelf earneſtly wiſheth this wiſdom to <hi>Iſrael</hi> his People, <hi>O that they were wiſe; that they underſtood this, that they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their latter end!</hi> Can we then render the night more ſenſeleſs? or keep the Bed unſpotted from thoſe Impurities that are neither few nor ſmall, then by practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing duely this Divine Art, of numbering our dayes? which is not done by any ſpeculation, or prying into the time or manner of our death: but by meditating and thinking with our ſelves what our dayes are, and for what end our life is given unto us; by reckoning our day by our work, and not by our time; by what we do, and not by what we are: By remembring that we are in a continual progreſs to the Chambers of death; no Mans life being ſo long at the evening as it was in the morning. Night and day are as two Axes at the root of our life, when one is lifted up, the other is down, without reſt: every day a Chip flies off, and every night a Chip, and ſo at length we are hewen down, and fall at the Graves mouth. O what a wide difference is there between thoſe that lie down with theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in their Boſomes, and others, who paſs their time in pleaſures, and allow not the leaſt portion of it, to think what the iſſues are that a day or night may bring forth? How free are their Converſations from thoſe ſenſualities and luſts, which others commit in the day, and lie down with the guilt of them in the night? How profitably do they improve their time who count onely the <hi>preſent</hi> to be theirs, and the <hi>future</hi> to be
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64536:101"/> Gods; above thoſe, that fancy youth and ſtrength to be a ſecurity of the ſucceeding proportions of their life? yea, how comfortable is death to thoſe, who are in dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preparation for it, as well as in expectation of it, above what it is to others, who are ſurprized by it in the midſt of thoſe delights, in which they promiſed themſelves a continuance for many yeares? In what a differing frame and figure doth it appear to the one and to the other? The one behold it as a Bridg lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their feet to paſs them over the <hi>Jordan</hi> of this life, into the <hi>Canaan</hi> of eternall Bleſſedneſs; and the other as a Torrent roaring and frighting them with its haſty downfall: Gladly therefore would I counſell Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who enter into the Church Militant by a <hi>myſticall</hi> death, being buried with Chriſt by Baptiſme, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſs into the Triumphant, but by a <hi>Natural</hi> death, to bear dayly in their Mindes the Cogitations of their inevitable end, as the beſt meanes to allay the fear of death, in what dreſs ſoever it comes, and to make it an inlet into happineſs whenſoever it comes. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> made his Sepulcre in his <hi>Garden,</hi> that in the midſt of his delights he might think of death; So let us in our <hi>Chambers</hi> make ſuch Schemes and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of Death to our ſelves, as may make it fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to us in the Emblemes of it, and then it will be leſs gaſtly when we behold its true viſage. When we ſtrip our ſelves of our Garments, think, <hi>That ſhortly</hi> (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith) <hi>we muſt put off this our Tabernacle.</hi> I, and think again, what a likeneſs there is between our <hi>Night-Clothes,</hi> and our <hi>Grave-Clothes,</hi> between the <hi>Bed</hi> and the <hi>Tombe.</hi> What a little diſtance there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>life</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> the one being as an <hi>Eye open,</hi> and the other as an <hi>Eye ſhut:</hi> in the twinkling of an eye we may be living and dead Men.

               <head>Meditation LX. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the Natural Heat, and the Radical Moiſture.</head>
               <p>THere is a Regiment of Health in the Soul, as well as in the Body; in the inward Man as well as in the outward Man; they being both ſubjects incident to diſtempers, and that from a defect, or exceſs in thoſe qualities, which when duely regulated are the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Baſis of life and ſtrength. What preſerves and maintaines the Natural life, but the juſt tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Radicall Moisture,</hi> and the <hi>innate heat?</hi> and what again endangers and deſtroyes it, but the heat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the moiſture, or the moiſture impairing the heat? When either of theſe prevail againſt each other, diſeaſes do ſuddenly follow. And is it not thus in the Soul, and Inward Man? In it thoſe two ſignal Graces of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> do keep up and cheriſh the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64536:102"/> Spiritual life of a Chriſtian; Faith being like <hi>Calor inna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> the Natural heat; and Repentance like <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum Radicale,</hi> the Radical moiſture. If then any by believing ſhould exerciſe Repentance leſs, or in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting ſhould leſſen their Believing, they would ſoon fall into one of thoſe moſt dangerous extreams, either to be ſwallowed up of Sorrow and deſpair, or elſe to be puffed up with ſecurity and preſumption. Is it not then matter of Complaint that theſe two <hi>Evangelicall Duties</hi> (as ſome Divines have called them) which in the practiſe of Chriſtians ſhould never be ſeparated, ſhould be lookt upon by many to oppoſe, rather then to promote each other in their operations: Some out of weakneſs cannot apprehend what conſiſtency there can be between Faith and Repentance, whoſe effects ſeem to be contrary, the one working Peace and Joy, the other trouble and ſorrow; the one Confidence, the other fear; the one Shame, the other boldneſs. Now ſuch as theſe, when touched with the ſenſe of their ſin, judge it their duty rather to mourn, then to believe, and to feel the bitterneſs of ſin, then to taſte the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Promiſe, and put away comfort from them, leaſt it ſhould check and abate the over-flowings of their ſorrow. Others again, whether out of heedleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or wilfullneſs, I will not determine, when they behold the fullneſs of Grace, in the blotting out of ſin, the freeneſs of Grace in the healing of Backſlidings, they ſee ſo little neceſſity of Repentance, as they think it below (as they ſo ſpeak) a Goſpel Spirit to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for that which Chriſt hath ſatisfied for. It is not Repentance that they ſhould now exerciſe, but Faith; Sorrow ſeems interpretatively to be a jealouſie of the truth of Gods Promiſe in forgiving, and of the ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Chriſts Diſcharge, who was the ſurety, who
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:64536:103"/> hath not left one ſingle Mite of the <hi>Debt</hi> for believers to Pay. Sorrow therefore ſeems to them as unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, as it would be for a Priſoner to mourn, when the Priſon door is opened, and himſelf ſet free from debt and bondage.</p>
               <p>Thus this pair of Graces and duties, concerning which I may ſay as God did of <hi>Adam,</hi> it is not good that either of them ſhould be alone: are yet divided often times in the <hi>practiſe,</hi> though indiſſolubly linked together in the Precept. Fain would I therefore evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the <hi>weak</hi> the <hi>concord</hi> of theſe two graces, in reſpect of <hi>Comfort:</hi> and to the <hi>wilfull</hi> the neceſſity of them both, in order unto Pardon.</p>
               <p>Unto the <hi>weak</hi> therefore I ſay, That the Agreement between Faith and Repentance, doth not lie in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate impreſſions, which they make upon the Soul, which are in ſome reſpects oppoſite to each other; but in the <hi>Principle</hi> from which they ariſe, which is the ſame, the Grace of Chriſt; and in the end which is the ſame, the ſalvation of Man, and in <hi>habitude</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination that they have one to another; for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is never more kindly then when it diſpoſeth us to the exerciſe and actings of Faith; whoſe comforts of joy, Peace, and Serenity of heart, are as Gold which is beſt laid upon ſad and dark colours; or as the Poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Diamond,</hi> that receiveth an addition of luſtre from the watering of it. Gods Promiſe is, that the Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jewes,</hi> who look upon Chriſt by an eye of Faith, ſhall be alſo great Mourners, <hi>They ſhall mourn for him as one mourneth for his onely ſon, and ſhall be in bitterneſs for him, as one that is in bitterneſs for his firſt borne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto the <hi>careleſs,</hi> or <hi>wilfull,</hi> I alſo ſay, That God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forgiveth ſin, but where alſo he giveth a Penitent and Relenting Heart; So that though Faith hath a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:64536:103"/> nature in the receiving of pardon, applying it by way of Inſtrument which no other grace doth; yet Repentance is the <hi>expreſs formal</hi> qualification that fits for pardon, not by way of <hi>cauſality</hi> or <hi>merit,</hi> but by way of <hi>means,</hi> as well as of <hi>command,</hi> which ariſeth from a <hi>Condecency</hi> both to God himſelf, who is an holy God, and to the nature of the Mercy, which is the taking and removing of Sin away. Never dream then of ſuch free grace, or Goſpel mercy, as doth ſupercede a broken and a contrite heart, or take off the neceſſity of ſorrowing for ſin. For Chriſt did never undertake to ſatisfie Gods wrath in an <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>illimited</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but in a well <hi>ordered</hi> and <hi>meet</hi> way, <hi>viz.</hi> the way of Faith and Repentance. How elſe ſhould we ever come to taſte the bitterneſs of ſin, or the ſweetneſs of grace? How to prize and eſteem the Phyſician if not ſenſible of our diſeaſe? How to adore the love of Chriſt, who redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, by being made a Curſe for us, if not burdened with the weight of our Iniquities? Yea, how ſhould we ever give God the glory of his Juſtice, in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves worthy of death, if we do not in a way of repentance judge our ſelves, as the Apoſtle bids us? Was not this that <hi>David</hi> did in that ſolemn Confeſſion of his? In which he cries out, <hi>Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight, that thou mightſt be juſtified when thou ſpeakeſt, and clear when thou judgeſt.</hi> Can I therefore wiſh a better wiſh to ſuch who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of their ſins, than <hi>Bernard</hi> did, to him whom he thought not heedful enough about the judgments of God, who writing to him, inſtead of the common Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation, wiſhing him, <hi>Salutem plurimam,</hi> much health, ſaid, <hi>Timorem plurimum,</hi> much fear; that ſo their confidence may have an allay of trembling? Sure I
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64536:104"/> am that it is a mercy that I had need to pray for on my own behalf, and I do, Lord, make it my requeſt, that my faith for the pardon of ſin may be accompanied with my ſorrow for ſin, and that I may have a <hi>weeping eye,</hi> as well as a <hi>believing heart,</hi> that I may mourn for the evils that I have done againſt my Saviour, as well as rejoyce in the fulneſs of mercy that he hath ſhewed to me in a glorious Salvation.</p>
